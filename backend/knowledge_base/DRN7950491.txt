complaint
Miss C complains that a credit agreement which she entered into with Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd wasn’t explained to her properly. She says she wasn’t told that interest would be 
charged during the 12 month Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) period if she didn’t settle the loan 
within that time and that if this has been explained to her before she entered into the credit 
agreement she would have made sure that she settled within the BNPL period.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy of which is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained why I didn’t consider that there had been a 
misrepresentation and why I proposed not to uphold Miss C’s complaint. I invited Miss C and 
Creation to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to make before I 
finally determined the matter.
Miss C said she had nothing further to add. Creation didn’t reply to my provisional decision.
my findings
I’ve reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither Miss C nor Creation has made any further arguments. So I see no reason to reach 
different conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons – as well as those set out in my provisional decision – my final decision is 
that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 October 2018.
