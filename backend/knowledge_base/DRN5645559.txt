complaint
Miss J complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy to her. 
background
In 2006 Miss J bought a television in a shop and took out a £1,799.99 loan to pay for it. At 
the same time Creation sold her a PPI policy which cost £605.44. This was added to the 
loan and repaid over the 60-month term. The interest on the policy was £406.76.  
Our adjudicator upheld Miss J’s complaint, because she didn’t think Creation had made clear 
to Miss J how much the policy would cost. Creation disagreed. It said the paperwork it gave 
Miss J when she bought the policy would have made her aware of the cost.  
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Miss J’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Miss J how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the total cost 
included a warranty Miss J bought at the same time. And the credit agreement didn’t 
show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Miss J to work 
out the interest herself. She was entitled to expect all the important information about the 
cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Miss J would expect it to be. And I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to her attention, particularly when she was in a shop and her attention 
was on buying a television – not on buying insurance. 

Even if Miss J did see the statement of price, it showed the wrong total cost of the policy 
(£102.20 instead of £1,102.20). It’s likely this would have confused, and possibly misled, 
her.  

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Miss J better understand what it was costing her.  

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Miss J was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
she would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as she was borrowing a fairly modest amount for a non-essential item. 

I don’t think Miss J would have bought the policy if she‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost her.

For these reasons, I uphold Miss J’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Miss J should be put back in the position she would now be in if she’d taken out the loan 
without the PPI. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term. Creation should 
now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Miss J because PPI was added 
to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Miss J had taken out the 
loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Miss J actually paid, and paying her the difference; 
and

paying Miss J simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Miss J setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Miss J needs to take any further action will depend on her financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Miss J should refer back to Creation if she’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Miss J 
and Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the 
tax treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
I uphold Miss J’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay her the compensation 
I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss J to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 December 2014.
