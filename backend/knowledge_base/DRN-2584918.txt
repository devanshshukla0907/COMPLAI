The complaint
Mrs I complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited won’t replace a faulty sofa that she 
paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement or refund to her the amount that she paid for the 
sofa.
What happened
Mrs I entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance, that she 
electronically signed in December 2019, to pay for a sofa. She says that the sofa was broken 
when it was delivered and that the supplier agreed to replace it. But the supplier has stopped 
trading and she hasn’t received a replacement so she made a claim to Creation Consumer 
Finance in July 2020 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
It said that, as the claim was received over six months after receipt of the sofa, it would 
require an independent report to confirm the fault and the cause of the fault, to enable it to 
review Mrs I’s claim further. It says that it hasn’t received an independent report. Mrs I wasn’t 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didn’t recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She thought that it 
was fair for Creation Consumer Finance to ask Mrs I to provide more evidence to validate 
her section 75 claim and that it had dealt with her claim fairly. 
Mrs I has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that she 
complained to the supplier many times about receiving a broken sofa from the first day and 
didn’t get any response. She says that she was making the payments every month as 
planned but stopped the payments because she hasn’t received a replacement sofa.
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:

Mrs I paid for the sofa using credit provided by Creation Consumer Finance in the 
form of a fixed sum loan;

in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;

to be able to uphold Mrs I’s complaint about Creation Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the sofa and that Creation Consumer Finance‘s response to her claim under 
section 75 wasn’t fair or reasonable – but I’m not determining the outcome of Mrs I’s 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;

Mrs I says that the sofa was broken when it was supplied to her and that she 
complained to the supplier but it didn’t respond – she also says that the supplier 
agreed to replace the sofa but I’ve seen no other evidence to show that it had agreed 
to replace the sofa;

Mrs I made a section 75 claim to Creation Consumer Finance in July 2020 – which 
was more than six months after she bought the sofa – and she says that the supplier 
has stopped trading;

Creation Consumer Finance says that it received an update from the supplier 
confirming that it was going to send in its technicians - which didn’t match Mrs I’s 
understanding that the supplier was going to replace her sofa;

it said that, as Mrs I’s claim was received over six months after receipt of the sofa, it 
would require an independent report to confirm the fault and the cause of the fault, to 
enable it to review her claim further – but she hasn’t provided it with an independent 
report;

I’m not persuaded that there’s enough evidence to show that the sofa was broken 
when it was received by Mrs I or that the supplier had agreed to replace it – nor am I 
persuaded that there’s enough evidence to show that there’s been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier in these circumstances;

I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Creation Consumer Finance to require 
Mrs I to provide evidence in the form of an independent report to show that there was 
a fault with the sofa and what was likely to have caused it;

Mrs I hasn’t provided it with the evidence that it required and I consider that it’s acted 
fairly and reasonably in not taking any further action on her claim;

I sympathise with Mrs I for the difficulties that she’s experienced but I consider that 
Creation Consumer Finance’s response to her claim has been fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances; 

Mrs I says that she’s stopped making the monthly repayments under the fixed sum 
loan agreement to Creation Consumer Finance – that puts her in breach of the 
agreement and I suggest that she contacts it to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the amount that she owes it;

if she’s experiencing financial difficulties, it’s required to respond to those difficulties 
positively and sympathetically – but, if she doesn’t make the payment to Creation 
Consumer Finance, I consider it to be more likely than not that it will take further 
action, to the extent that it’s legally entitled to do so, to recover that amount from her; 
and

I find that it wouldn’t be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Creation Consumer Finance to arrange for the sofa to be replaced, to refund to Mrs I 
any of the money that she’s paid for the sofa, to pay her any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I don’t uphold Mrs I’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs I to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2021.
