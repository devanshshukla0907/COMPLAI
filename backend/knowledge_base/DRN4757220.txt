complaint
Miss N complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited cancelled her fixed sum loan 
agreement before she received the furniture that she was buying with the loan. 
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I won’t repeat them again here. Instead I’ll focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint – including Miss N’s response to the 
investigator’s recommendation. Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the 
investigator for these reasons:

Creation has recognised that its cancellation of Miss N’s agreement has caused her 
stress and inconvenience – its apologised for that and paid her £500 compensation;

it says that her loan application shouldn’t have been accepted because it didn’t meet 
its lending criteria and I consider that it should have checked that the application met 
its lending criteria before it agreed to lend to Miss N;

Miss N has described the distress and inconvenience that she’s been caused and 
says that she gave away the furniture that was being replaced so was without it over 
the Christmas period;

she says that Creation should reimburse her £3,000 for the loss of the furniture that 
she gave away and to compensate her for the stress and aggravation that she’s been 
caused;

I sympathise with Miss N for these events and I can understand the frustration that 
she feels about her agreement being cancelled after she’d given her furniture away – 
but it was her decision to give that furniture away before she received the 
replacement furniture and I’m not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Creation to reimburse her for that furniture;

she hasn’t received the furniture that she was buying with the loan – but she’s been 
released from her liability to repay the loan; 

Miss N has clearly been caused distress and inconvenience by these events but I 
consider that the £500 that Creation has paid to her is fair and reasonable 
compensation for that distress and inconvenience; and

I’m not persuaded that it wouldn’t be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation to 
pay any other compensation to Miss N or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don’t uphold Miss N’s complaint.
