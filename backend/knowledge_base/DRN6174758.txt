complaint
Mrs V complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy to her.
background
In 2005 Mrs V bought furniture in a shop and took out a loan to pay for it. At the same time 
Creation sold her a PPI policy. This was added to the loan and repaid over the loan term.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint because he thought Creation had made it clear 
how much the policy would cost.
I issued my provisional decision in November 2014, a copy of which is attached and forms 
part of this final decision. In my provisional decision, I explained why I upheld Mrs V’s 
complaint. I invited both parties to let me have any further comments before I reached a final 
decision.
Neither party responded with any new information.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has responded with any further information for me to consider, I see no 
reason to alter the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. I uphold Mrs V’s 
complaint.
fair compensation
Mrs V should be put back in the position she would now be in if she’d taken out the loan 
without the PPI. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term. 
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mrs V because PPI was added 
to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mrs V had taken out the 
loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mrs V actually paid, and paying her the difference; 
and

paying Mrs V simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mrs V setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).

† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mrs V needs to take any further action will depend on her financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mrs V should refer back to Creation if she’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mrs V 
and Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the 
tax treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
For the reasons set out above and in my provisional decision I uphold Mrs V’s complaint. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay Mrs V compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs V to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 February 2015.

my provisional findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I do not agree with the adjudicator that Creation told Mrs V how much the policy cost. I say 
this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mrs V to work it out 
for herself. She was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it seems to have been on page two of 
a document setting out information about the policy. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mrs 
V would expect it to be. I can’t be sure it was drawn to her attention, particularly when 
she was in a shop and her attention was on buying furniture – not on buying insurance. 
Mrs V says (and I accept) that the cost was not discussed. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mrs V better understand what it was costing her. 

I don’t think Mrs V would have bought the policy if she‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost her, compared to the modest amount she was borrowing.
For these reasons, my provisional decision is to uphold Mrs V’s complaint.

my provisional decision
I intend to uphold Mrs V’s complaint. And direct Creation Financial Services Limited to pay 
her the compensation I’ve described above.
Creation and Mrs V should write to me by 9 December 2014 with any further submissions 
they wish to make, after which I will issue my decision.
