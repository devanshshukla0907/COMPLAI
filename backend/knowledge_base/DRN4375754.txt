complaint
Mr A’s unhappy that he couldn’t log into his Creation Consumer Finance Ltd account and 
pay off his balance on the last day of his special offer interest free period. He wants the 
interest waived and his credit file amended.
background
Our adjudicator felt the complaint shouldn’t be upheld. He said:

When Mr A spoke to Creation the day after he couldn’t access his account on his 
phone, he said this might’ve been because he’d inputted his details into the wrong 
fields. 

Creation’s confirmed there were no IT issues reported on its site that night.

Creation offered to review the interest if Mr A paid the cash price of the product he’d 
bought to show he could’ve paid the outstanding amount the previous day. But Mr A 
chose not to do so.

Creation had acted fairly and hadn’t made an error. So, it wouldn’t be fair or 
reasonable to recommend it waives the interest or amends Mr A’s credit file.
Mr A doesn’t agree and has asked for an ombudsman review. He says he’s sure he didn’t 
put information into the wrong fields. He added it in the normal way. He’s not sure why his 
access was blocked but is certain it was a computer glitch not human error. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree with the adjudicator’s conclusions for the same reasons. 
On balance I don’t think there was a “computer glitch” when Mr A tried to log in as he 
suggests. And I don’t think Creation’s done anything wrong or acted unfairly. 
Although I recognise Mr A’s frustration, I don’t see a compelling reason to change the 
proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I don’t uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 February 2016.
