complaint
Mr M complains about a loan he took out with Creation Consumer Finance Limited 
(“Creation”).
 
background
Mr M took out a loan with Creation in June 2011 to buy a car. The amount to be repaid, as 
shown on Creation’s account at that point, was £5790. Mr M made repayments until 
April 2012. He then asked Creation for a statement to show how much he had to pay to 
settle the loan in June 2012. Creation wrote to him on 8 June 2012 and said that £3,956.62 
was required if the loan was repaid by the end of June 2012. Mr M then part- exchanged his 
car. He said that the dealership dealing with the part-exchange (“Q”) was settling his loan. A 
cheque for £2,000 was sent to Creation in July 2012. Mr M heard no further from Creation 
until May 2013 when Creation said that £2,328.87 was still required to repay the loan. But as 
Mr M thought his loan had been repaid when he part-exchanged his car, he complained to 
this service.
The adjudicator did not recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr M 
knew in June 2012 that he had to repay £3,956.62 to settle the loan. As only £2,000 was 
then repaid in July 2012, this was not enough to settle the loan. So, the loan remained open 
and interest continued to accrue, and Mr M was still obliged to repay his loan.
Mr M disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that he thought that Q was paying off his 
loan. He also said that Creation should have recovered his car and sold it at auction to pay 
off his finance. He also said that Q had since ceased to trade.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that the amount repayable on Mr M’s loan in June 2011 was £5,790. Mr M then 
repaid £1,256.50 until April 2012 when he stopped his repayments. So, I consider that Mr M 
should have reasonably known that more than £2,000 was required to repay the balance of 
the loan. And I note that he had requested a redemption statement from Creation which was 
sent to him in June 2012 showing that £3,956.62 was required to settle the loan.
Mr M said that he thought that Q was paying off his loan following the part-exchange. I do 
not know if Q sent the £2,000 cheque to Creation or if Mr M sent this. But if Q had told Mr M 
that it was paying off the loan and then sent an amount which was less than required, it is 
still Mr M’s responsibility under the terms of his loan agreement to repay the balance. If Mr M 
or Q had made an error in sending less than required, I am not persuaded that this was 
caused by any error by Creation.
I can also see that Mr M said that Creation should have recovered the car and sold it to pay 
off the balance of the account. But as the loan agreement was a fixed sum loan agreement, 
Creation had no legal right to recover the car. 
So, although I have sympathy for the position Mr M now finds himself in, I am satisfied that 
Creation’s loan has not been settled, and that the loan balance remains to be paid by Mr M.
