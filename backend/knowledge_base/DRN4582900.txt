complaint
Mr L complains that two sofas that he paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited weren’t of satisfactory quality. 
background 
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I won’t repeat them again here. Instead, I’ll focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:

Mr L entered in to a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance that 
he electronically signed in May 2016 to pay for two sofas that cost a total of £3,021 – 
the loan was interest free and was to be repaid by 48 monthly payments of £62.93;

Creation Consumer Finance, as the provider of credit to Mr L, is jointly liable with the 
supplier of the sofa for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier – 
and the breach of contract about which Mr L has complained would be that the sofas 
weren’t of satisfactory quality when he bought them;

to be able to uphold Mr L’s complaint about Creation Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that the sofas weren’t of satisfactory quality and that Creation Consumer 
Finance’s response to his complaint wasn’t fair or reasonable;

Mr L complained to the supplier about some issues with the sofas and it arranged for 
them to be inspected by an independent expert in March 2018 – the inspection report 
concluded that the issues were due to normal wear and tear and that there was no 
fault with them;

Mr L continued to complain about those issues so the supplier arranged a second 
independent inspection in June 2018 – the expert said that there were no 
manufacturing faults with the sofas but said that the issues about which Mr L had 
complained were due to settling of the foam – and the expert added some more foam 
to the sofas;

neither of the independent experts found a manufacturing fault with the sofas and the 
second expert added some foam to deal with the settling of the foam in the sofas – 
but I’m not persuaded that it’s unreasonable that the foam in a sofa would show 
some signs of settling after more than two years of use;

Mr L has made detailed comments about the two inspection reports but I consider 
that it’s fair and reasonable for me to rely on the findings of those reports in deciding 
what’s fair and reasonable in these circumstances;

Mr L then complained to Creation Consumer Finance about the sofas and said that 
he was going to stop his payments for them so it explained to him the consequences 
of stopping his payments on his credit file and it sent him arrears letters;


Mr L then asked it to investigate his concerns and he sent it copies of his 
correspondence with the supplier but Creation Consumer Finance didn’t investigate 
his complaint;

our investigator recommended that Creation Consumer Finance should pay £50 to 
Mr L to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused by its 
failure to properly investigate his concerns – and it has agreed to make that payment 
to him;

Mr L has provided three quotes that he obtained earlier this year for additional work 
that he says is required on the sofas – but none of those quotes refers to a 
manufacturing fault with the sofas or says that they wouldn’t have been of 
satisfactory quality when he bought them;

it’s clear that Mr L feels very strongly that the sofas weren’t of satisfactory quality and 
he’s made detailed submissions to this service – I haven’t responded to each of the 
points that Mr L has made (and intend him no discourtesy in that) but I’ve dealt with 
the issues that I consider are relevant for me to reach a fair and reasonable decision 
on his complaint; and

I sympathise with Mr L for the disappointment and frustration that he feels about the 
sofas, but I’m not persuaded that there’s enough evidence to show that the sofas 
weren’t of satisfactory quality when he bought them so I don’t consider that it would 
be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer Finance to refund to him 
the money that he’s paid it under the agreement or to pay for the sofas to be 
repaired.
Creation Consumer Finance has agreed to pay £50 compensation to Mr L for the distress 
and inconvenience that he was caused by its failure to properly investigate his complaint. 
I consider that to be fair and reasonable in these circumstances - but I’m not persuaded that 
it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay more compensation than that to Mr L 
or to remove any adverse information that it’s recorded on his credit file.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr L’s complaint in part and I order Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited to pay him £50 to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he’s been 
caused.
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 December 2020.
