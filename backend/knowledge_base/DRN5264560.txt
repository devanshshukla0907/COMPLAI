complaint
Mr A complains that a laptop financed by a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation 
Consumer Finance Limited was misrepresented to him. It was not suitable for his business 
needs. 
background
Mr A bought a laptop using a fixed sum loan agreement from Creation in mid 2013. This was 
for use in his painting and decorating business. Mr A says he was advised that the laptop 
was suitable for this purpose. Mr A needed it to provide estimates for his customers, to email 
customers and search the internet. 
Mr A was unable to use the laptop for his business. It froze regularly, and could not cope 
with multiple applications being open at the same time. He took it back to the supplier. It was 
tested for faults. None were found, but the problems continued to occur. Mr A brought a 
complaint to us to consider. 
The adjudicator initially recommended that the complaint should not be upheld. He 
considered the performance specification of the laptop was made clear in the documents 
accompanying it. The adjudicator was not satisfied that the laptop had been misrepresented 
to Mr A.
Mr A did not agree with the adjudicator’s recommendation. He obtained an expert report on 
the capabilities of the laptop. This concluded that the processor was not suitable for 
business use. The laptop cannot use multiple applications at the same time. It has a small 
memory and hard drive capacity. 
In light of the expert report, the adjudicator issued a second view recommending that the 
complaint should be upheld. He considered that the suitability of the laptop for business 
purposes had been misrepresented to Mr A. The adjudicator considered that Mr A had relied 
on the advice of the salesperson as to whether the laptop could be used in his business. 
The adjudicator recommended that the fixed sum loan should be cancelled. Details of it 
should be removed from Mr A’s credit file. Creation should refund the deposit paid by Mr A. It 
should also refund the payments made by him less 10% for his limited use. Interest should 
be paid on both amounts at 8%. In addition, Creation should pay Mr A £20 for the cost of the 
report. 
Creation is not happy to accept the adjudicator’s recommendation. It says Mr A did not 
contact the supplier until three months after he bought the laptop. This delay would suggest 
it was fit for purpose. Creation is prepared to refund the £20 report fee. 
In response, the adjudicator pointed out that Mr A contacted the supplier within a week of the 
purchase date. It referred him to its technical experts. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.

Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities – in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Mr A says that it was apparent within a week of buying the laptop that it was not suitable for 
his business needs. This was the reason he had bought it. I am satisfied that Mr A made the 
reason for the purchase clear to the supplier before he bought the laptop. I find that he 
received an assurance that it could be used for business purposes. In fact this is not correct. 
As the expert report points out, the specifications of the laptop are not suitable for the needs 
of Mr A’s business. As such, I find that the capabilities of the laptop were misrepresented to 
Mr A. 
I note that Creation says that Mr A would have complained earlier than he did if the laptop 
had been unsuitable. I find that Mr A returned it to the supplier within a week of purchase to 
discuss his concerns. It was referred to the in house knowhow team. I am therefore satisfied 
that Mr A raised the problems he was experiencing with the laptop shortly after buying it. 
As I find the laptop was misrepresented to Mr A, Creation should:

Arrange for the return of the laptop at no cost to Mr A.

Cancel the loan agreement

Refund the payments Mr A has made under the agreement to date less 10% for 
limited usage

Refund the £20 report fee

Refund any deposit paid

Remove any reference to the agreement from Mr A’s credit file

Pay annual interest at 8% interest on the above payments from the date of payment 
to the date of settlement.
my final decision
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 January 2015.
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In settlement of it, Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited should:

Arrange for the return of the laptop at no cost to Mr A.

Cancel the loan agreement

Refund the payments Mr A has made under the agreement to date less 10% for 
limited usage

Refund the £20 report fee

Refund any deposit paid

Remove any reference to the agreement from Mr A’s credit file

Pay annual interest at 8% simple per year on the above payments from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement.
If Creation chooses to deduct tax from the interest element of my award it should provide Mr 
A with a certificate of tax deduction so he may claim a refund, if appropriate.
