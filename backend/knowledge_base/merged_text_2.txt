complaint
Mr F complains that the secondary glazing he paid for through a fixed sum loan agreement 
with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd was not fit for purpose.
background
Mr F says that when he ordered the secondary glazing he checked with the salesman that it 
would not restrict the ability for his windows to open inwards. He says that he had his 
windows adapted a number of years beforehand so they could be opened inwards to enable 
them to be cleaned and maintained from indoors. Following the salesperson’s visit, an 
inspection took place to ensure the suitability of the glazing. Mr F says the inspector was 
aware of his requirements. The second glazing was installed in January 2015.
Mr F says that it was not until months later when he wanted to have some maintenance 
carried out that he discovered the secondary glazing prevented the windows from being 
opened inwards. He contacted the supplier which explained that the only way to have 
maintenance carried out from the inside would be to have the windows removed and then 
replaced once the work had been done. It said this would cost approximately £1,000 and an 
offer was made to cover the cost of doing this the first time. Mr F said he wanted the glazing 
removed and a full refund as he did not want to be incurring additional costs every time 
maintenance was required.
Creation did not uphold Mr F’s complaint. It says it discussed his complaint with the supplier 
which said it had offered as a goodwill gesture to remove and then replace the windows 
when painting was required as a one off. It says the supplier had closed this complaint as it 
had not had contact from Mr F.
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint. He said that the supplier had a duty of care to identify 
and let Mr F know his windows would no longer operate in the same way after the 
installation. This didn’t happen and the installation meant the normal operation of the 
windows was restricted. He said the glazing had been misrepresented and that had Mr F 
known he would no longer be able to open the windows inward he would not have gone 
ahead with the installation. 
Creation did not agree with our adjudicator’s view.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F paid for his secondary glazing with a fixed sum loan agreement. Under the regulations 
Creation is liable if there was a breach of contract or a misrepresentation by the supplier.
In this case Mr F had windows that opened inwards. He has explained why this was 
important given the position of his property and the need to undertake regular maintenance 
from the inside. Mr F has said he had his windows adapted a number of years before the 
secondary glazing to enable them to open inwards.
Based on what Mr F has said I can see why it was important to him that his windows 
continued to be able to be opened inwards after the secondary glazing was installed. He has

said that he told the salesperson this and he was told this would be fine. A technical survey 
was then carried out.
Given the importance of the operation of the windows I find it more likely than not that Mr F 
would have raised this issue before agreeing to the secondary glazing. Given a technical 
survey was carried out this should have identified whether the glazing was suitable for Mr F’s 
windows. Mr F says the person carrying out the survey was aware of his needs.
On balance I find it more likely than not that Mr F raised the issue of his windows needing to 
open inwards after the installation and based on the information he received, believed this 
would still be able to happen. 
Mr F did not raise his complaint until October 2016 even though the glazing was installed in 
January 2015. He has explained that he only became aware of the issue when he wanted to 
have the outside of the windows painted. 
Had Mr F been aware that the glazing would restrict the operation of his windows I accept 
that he would not have gone ahead with the installation. Because I think it more likely than 
not that Mr F was led to believe his windows would still be able to open inwards after the 
installation I believe a misrepresentation has occurred.
The supplier has said that the windows cannot be adapted and that the only way to have the 
maintenance done from the inside is to remove the windows and then replace them. It 
offered to cover the cost of this on the first occassion. Given the issue will be ongoing and 
Mr F would be required to have the windows removed each time he needed to carry out 
maintenance I can see why this was not an acceptable resolution for him.
Overall, given the specific circumstances of this case, I find the fair resolution is for the 
glazing to be removed from Mr F’s windows at no cost to him and the payment he has made 
under his agreement to be refunded.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:
1.
arrange to have the secondary glazing removed from Mr F's property at his 
convenience and at no cost to him; and
2.
refund all payments Mr F has made for the secondary glazing plus 8% simple interest 
from the date of payment to the date of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2017.

complaint
Mrs H complains that the solar panels she obtained through a fixed sum loan agreement 
with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd were misrepresented to her.
background
Mrs H says she was led to believe that the energy generated from the solar panels would 
cover the loan repayments. But when the first payment was received, it was much lower than 
she had anticipated.
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She concluded that 
Mrs H had been given misleading information which induced her to enter into the agreement. 
The adjudicator recommended that the agreement should be cancelled, all payments 
refunded, any overdraft fees that Mrs H had incurred as a result of the loan payments be 
reimbursed and any adverse information recorded on her credit file be removed. If Creation 
wanted to remove the panels, it would need to make required repairs to the roof.
Creation responded to say, in summary, that the documentation signed by Mrs H shows the 
total savings and benefits and there was never a suggestion that Mrs H would receive 
enough to cover her monthly loan payments.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I find that I have come to 
the same conclusion as the adjudicator for much the same reasons.
Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, Mrs H may seek to recover money paid 
under the terms of the loan agreement from Creation if the supplier misrepresented the 
contract. I think the agreement was misrepresented; let me explain why.
The paperwork which Mrs H signed sets out the monthly cost of the loan agreement and the 
likely savings and benefits she would receive. The figures do not suggest she would receive 
enough to meet the monthly loan costs. But I consider the contract was verbally 
misrepresented to her. I say this because Mrs H has given this service a detailed recollection 
of the conversations she had with two of the supplier’s representatives. I am persuaded from 
what she has told us that she was led to believe, by both representatives, that the cost of the 
agreement would be covered by the benefit she would receive from the energy created by 
the solar panels. Taking into account her age and her financial circumstances, I don’t think 
she would reasonably have entered into the agreement if she had known the panels would 
not generate enough benefits and savings to meet her monthly costs. This is supported by 
the fact that she has had difficulty meeting the monthly repayments.
As I have concluded Mrs H would not have entered into the agreement if it had not been 
misrepresented to her, I consider she should be put back in the position she would have 
been in had she not taken out the agreement.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN6914315
--------------------------

2
The adjudicator recommended that Creation refund the overdraft fees Mrs H has incurred as 
a result of the loan repayments. But, although I think the loan repayments have not helped 
Mrs H’s overall financial position, it appears from her account statements that she would 
have incurred overdraft interest even without these payments. So I don’t think Creation 
should be liable for her overdraft fees. But I don’t think Mrs H should have incurred any costs 
as a result of entering into this agreement, so I think Creation should pay her £15 to cover 
her telephone and postal costs.
my final decision
For the reasons I have explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and 
final settlement, I order Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:
1.
Cancel the agreement and refund all payments made, less the payments Mrs H has 
received from National Grid. Creation may opt to either leave the panels in place or 
make the necessary repairs to the roof should it opt to remove them.
2.
Remove any adverse information from Mrs H’s credit file in respect of this loan 
agreement.
3.
Pay Mrs H £15.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs H to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 August 2015.

complaint
Miss P complains she was told that a fixed sum loan she took with Creation Consumer 
Finance Limited was interest free for 24 months. But, this turned out not to be the case. 
background 
Miss P took the loan on 15 November 2014 to buy a computer. She says the salesman told 
her the loan was interest free for 24 months. She says she didn’t understand the agreement 
and relied on what the salesman said. She says she thought she’d been making monthly 
payments towards the loan. But, in November 2015, Creation said she hadn’t paid. And, if 
she didn’t pay in full, it would start charging interest for the next three years. She says the 
agreement was misrepresented. And, Creation took too long to respond to her complaint.
Creation says it wasn’t there at the point of sale, so can’t comment on what was said. It says 
it reviewed Miss P’s agreement. It’s satisfied this was only interest free, providing Miss P 
paid £506.47 for the goods, plus an early settlement fee of £25, before 16 November 2015. It 
says it wrote to Miss P in October 2015 to remind her of what she had to pay before it 
started charging interest. It says she signed the agreement, indicating she’d read and 
understood it. It agrees it delayed in responding to Miss P’s complaint, and apologised.  
The adjudicator says Miss P’s agreement allowed her to either pay in full within 12 months 
and pay no interest, or to pay in 36 monthly instalments, plus interest. She accepts Miss P 
felt she had relied on what the salesman said. But, she says she signed the agreement, 
indicating she was happy to go ahead and aware of the terms. She feels Miss P should have 
known she wasn’t making monthly payments. She doesn’t uphold the complaint.
After speaking with the adjudicator, Creation agreed to pay Miss P £100 as a gesture of 
goodwill for the delay in dealing with her complaint. The adjudicator thinks this is reasonable.
Miss P doesn’t agree. She says the salesman misled her. She says she wasn’t given a copy 
of the agreement – and thought she was making repayments. She wants Creation to change 
the agreement to allow her a further interest free year to pay. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss P says she’s very unhappy with the service she was given in store. But, under section 
75, Creation will only be jointly responsible for any breach of contract or misrepresentation 
by the supplier. This doesn’t extend to holding the finance company responsible for all of the 
supplier’s actions – including the poor service given. 
Miss P says she realised quite quickly that what she’d been told by the salesman wasn’t the 
same as what was written on the agreement. I appreciate she asked him to check the details 
with his manager. And, I can understand that after he did this, she was more confident about 
what she was told. But, I can’t ignore the fact that she signed a written agreement that set 
out very different terms and conditions. And, in signing that agreement, Miss P indicated that 
she’d read and understood that she’d be bound by it.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN6997362
--------------------------

2
I’ve considered the agreement, which is a short document. There’s a lot of small print. But, 
the repayment terms are set out at the top. And, I think these are very clear. The agreement 
is a “buy now, pay later” agreement for 12 months. As the adjudicator said, if the full amount 
isn’t paid in that time, the loan will be repayable with interest, over 36 months. Miss P herself 
says she noted there’s not a 24 month repayment term. She says she was told to ignore 
what was written on the agreement – and she chose to do so. I know she says she didn’t 
understand the agreement. I appreciate Miss P might have been influenced by what the 
salesman said. But, from reading her complaint, I’m satisfied she was in a position to make 
an informed choice about what she was agreeing to. 
Miss P says a further indication that she thought the loan was over 24 months was that she 
thought she’d already started making repayments. She says she checked her bank account 
and saw payments coming out each month, which she thought were for the loan. I haven’t 
seen Miss P’s bank statements. I think it’s reasonable to assume, if Miss P thought she had 
24 months to repay in order to avoid being charged any interest, she’d have made sure the 
monthly payments were going towards the computer.
Taking all things into account, I’m not persuaded that the agreement was misrepresented. 
Following the adjudicator’s involvement, Creation has agreed to pay Miss P £100 for the 
delay in dealing with her complaint. I think this is reasonable in the circumstances.
my final decision
My final decision is Creation Consumer Finance Limited should pay Miss P £100 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 May 2016.

complaint
Mrs H complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited, trading as Creation, will not 
cancel her loan agreement and refund her repayments for a solar panel system which she 
believes was mis-sold to her. The complaint is brought on her behalf by a family member, 
Mr H. But for ease, I shall refer below to all actions being taken by Mrs H.
background
Mrs H bought solar panels from a third party company, V, with finance provided by a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Creation in September 2014. The panels were installed in October 
2014. Mrs H said that the solar panel system was misrepresented to her by V. She said that 
its salesman told her on the phone when he cold called her, and during his visit to her house, 
that the solar panel system was self funding. Mrs H said that the salesman said that the 
value of her loan repayments would be covered by the rebate from the grid, and that this 
was likely to be high enough so that she could turn a small profit. She said that this was the 
deciding factor on which she based her decision to buy the system.
Mrs H signed a loan agreement with Creation under which she would pay £92.17 per month 
for ten years. Mrs H also said that she could suffer financial hardship if the system did not 
pay for itself.
Mrs H complained to Creation at the beginning of December 2014 that the system was mis-
sold to her, and she wanted her agreement cancelled. She realised that the cost of her 
energy together with her loan repayments had trebled her energy costs, and if she had 
known this, she wouldn’t have bought the system.
The adjudicator concluded that the performance of the solar panels, along with the estimated 
savings that Mrs H would make, were misrepresented. He said that the only reason Mrs H 
agreed to buy the solar panels was because she was informed that she would receive a 
profit based on the performance of the solar panels and the energy saved. Whilst he 
acknowledged that the calculations provided to Mrs H were estimates, he noted that Mrs H 
hadn’t received anything near the estimates provided. He recommended that Creation 
arrange for the system panels to be removed at its cost, that the loan agreement is cancelled 
and the loan repayments be reimbursed to Mrs H with interest at 8% paid from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement.
Creation disagreed and replied to say, in summary, that cancellation of the loan agreement 
was not warranted as Mrs H had proceeded with her purchase on the basis of figures which 
were provided as estimates. She had signed a form which said that the system performance 
was not guaranteed. It also said that Mrs H should wait until a year had elapsed as she was 
basing her views on the figure available for the winter months when there was less sun.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here), 
I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities – in other words, what I consider is most 
likely to have happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN6998746
--------------------------

2
I consider that the crux of this complaint is whether a misrepresentation had been made to 
Mrs H, and whether Mrs H had entered into the loan agreement because of that information.
I cannot be certain what was discussed between the sales representative and Mrs H before 
she entered into the agreement for the solar panels. But I note that she said that she was 
cold called by V’s salesman and told on the phone that the panels would pay for themselves. 
She said that she was also told this when he visited her and she only signed up in reliance 
on this.
Creation refers to a document headed “Customer satisfaction note” which Mrs H signed on 
25 September 2014. This said that the performance of the system was impossible to predict 
with certainty and that the estimate was given for guidance. It said that the figures were 
illustrative and actual savings varied. It then said that the performance expectations for the 
first year were an income of £343.74 and energy savings of £143.60, a total of £487.34. But 
the form does not refer to the annual loan repayments of £1,100 which Mrs H would have to 
pay to achieve such savings. So, I consider that the reference to annual savings on the form 
was misleading without also mentioning the loan repayments. By taking these into account, 
Mrs H is substantially worse off. As the adjudicator also noted, on the basis of V’s 
projections, it will take Mrs H around 20 years to earn the amount she borrowed. If this had 
also been explained to Mrs H at the point of sale, I am persuaded that she would not have 
gone ahead.
I also note that Creation felt that Mrs H should wait until she had seen the figures for a year. 
But, I can see that by waiting until she had received FIT payments for a year, she would be 
worse off financially than prior to her purchase because of the need to make her loan 
repayments. I especially note that Mrs H was concerned that the loan repayments would 
cause her financial difficulty if the loan did not pay for itself.
I find Mrs H’s evidence to be plausible and credible, and I am persuaded by what she tells 
us. Moreover, her recollections and actions are consistent, and she raised the issues with 
Creation just over two months after installation.
So, on balance, and after very careful consideration, overall I am persuaded that the system 
was mis-sold to Mrs H, and that she wouldn’t have gone ahead if she had known that the 
solar panel system wouldn’t pay for itself. I consider that Creation should arrange for the 
removal of the solar panel system at no cost to Mrs H, and to restore Mrs H’s property to its 
original state. It should also put Mrs H back into the position she would have been in by 
cancelling the loan and refunding to Mrs H the difference between the loan repayments she 
has made and the FIT income payments she has received. It should also pay Mrs H interest 
on her repayments at 8% simple per annum from the date of each payment to the date of 
settlement. It should also remove any information about the agreement from Mrs H’s credit 
file.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of this complaint, 
I order Creation Consumer Finance Limited, trading as Creation, to:-
1. Arrange at its cost for the removal of the solar panel system and the return of Mrs H’s 
property to the state it was in before the panels were installed. This means, for example, 
replacing any roof tiles rather than just repairing them;
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN6998746
--------------------------

3
2. Cancel Mrs H’s loan agreement;
3. Refund to Mrs H all the repayments she has made, after deducting the amounts she has 
received as income;
4. Interest should be calculated and paid to Mrs H on the payments refunded at 8% simple 
per annum from the date of each payment to the date of settlement; and
5. Remove any information about the agreement from Mrs H’s credit file.
If Creation considers it has to deduct tax from the interest element of my award, it should 
send Mrs H a tax deduction certificate when it pays her. She can use that certificate to try to 
reclaim the tax, if she is entitled to do so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs H to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 August 2015.

complaint
Mrs Q says that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy to her. 
background
In 2008 Mrs Q bought a freezer in a shop and she took out a £313.17 loan to pay for it. At 
the same time Creation sold her a PPI policy. The policy cost £152.26, which was added to 
the loan.  
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mrs Q wouldn’t pay interest if she paid 
off the credit before that date. Otherwise she’d pay interest (including £187.14 of interest on 
the policy) over the remaining 48 months of the loan.   
Our adjudicator upheld Mrs Q’s complaint. They didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And they didn’t think Mrs Q would have bought the policy if 
it had done so.  
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mrs Q was given would 
have made her aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mrs Q’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mrs Q how much the policy cost. I say this because:  
•
The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the total cost 
included a warranty Mrs Q bought at the same time. And the credit agreement didn’t 
show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mrs Q to 
work out the interest herself. She was entitled to expect all the important information 
about the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.  
•
The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mrs Q would expect it to be. And I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to her attention, particularly when she was in a shop and her 
attention was on buying a freezer – not on buying insurance. 
•
None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been 
good practice and might have helped Mrs Q to understand what the policy was 
costing her.  
•
The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mrs Q aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If she didn’t 
pay the loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, 
attracted interest at 32.4%. This meant Mrs Q would pay a substantial extra amount 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7015030
--------------------------

2
of interest on the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit she gained was 
‘free’ life cover.    
•
The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mrs Q was borrowing. This was unusual and I 
think Mrs Q would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to 
buy the policy. Especially as she was borrowing quite a modest amount over a fairly 
short term. 
 
•
I don’t think Mrs Q would have bought the policy if she‘d been made properly aware 
of how much it was going to cost her.
For these reasons, I uphold Mrs Q’s complaint.
fair compensation 
Mrs Q borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so her loan was bigger than it should’ve been and 
she paid more than she should’ve each month. So Mrs Q needs to get back the extra she’s 
paid. 
So, Creation should:

Work out and pay Mrs Q the difference between what she paid each month on the 
loan and what she would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mrs Q paid each month from when she paid 
it until she gets it back. The rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a 
year from then on†.

If Mrs Q made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what 
she got for the claim from the amount it owes her.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mrs Q a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that Mrs Q’s complaint is upheld. Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd must pay Mrs Q compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs Q to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 February 2015.

complaint
Mr J complains that he took out a loan with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd believing the 
interest rate was 11.9% Annual Percentage Rate of charge (APR), because this was how it 
was advertised – but the rate was in fact 16.9% APR. He wants the interest rate on his loan 
to be changed to 11.9% APR.
background
Mr J said that he received a letter from Creation offering a loan at 11.9% APR, and also saw 
online advertising by Creation offering the same rate. He completed an application process 
and took out a loan in November 2011, and then complained to Creation that the interest 
rate it had set for this loan was 16.9% APR. 
Creation sent a final response letter to Mr J, saying:

Its promotional advertising clearly explained that the APR figure was only 
representative

He had signed a legally binding loan agreement, where the interest rate was listed as 
16.9% APR

It was unable to conclude that any error had been made by Creation, and so it could 
not uphold his complaint   
Mr J referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Our adjudicator said that 
he had looked at the loan agreement, and could not conclude that the loan had been mis-
represented to Mr J. Therefore, he did not think the complaint should be upheld.
Mr J disagreed with our adjudicator, and asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I find that I have come to the same 
conclusion as our adjudicator, for the same reasons.
I sympathise with Mr J. Like our adjudicator, I can see how it was possible that he believed 
he would receive the 11.9% interest rate when applying for the loan. But both the pre-
contract information and the actual loan agreement clearly show the interest rate as 16.9% 
APR. Our adjudicator noted that Mr J signed the agreement, and Mr J has not disputed this 
point – so, he is bound by it.  
my final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.

complaint
Mr M first complains about a disputed credit agreement with Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited (“CCFL”). He also said that CCFL had incorrectly applied adverse entries to his 
credit file, but that CCFL’s agent agreed to remove the adverse entries when he partially 
settled his account, but they had not been removed.
background
Mr M entered into a loan agreement in August 2009 to buy furniture. Following a dispute, 
CCFL agreed to reduce the loan amount by almost £400, leaving almost £2,800 due, and 
change the end date of the agreement. Mr M said that a new agreement was needed in view 
of these changes. But because a new one was not issued, he did not make his payments. 
Mr M first complained in 2010 about the absence of a new agreement. CCFL said, in 
response, in July 2010, that a new contract was unnecessary, and it had given him a cost 
reduction to resolve his complaint. CCFL sent three further similar responses to 
Mr M’s complaint in September 2010, June 2011, and September 2011. Each letter said that 
he could raise his complaint with this service within six months of the date of each letter, but 
no complaint was sent. 
In January 2014, CCFL’s collection agent agreed with Mr M to accept the payment of £500 
in settlement of the outstanding loan balance of £2,745. Mr M said that the payment was 
made on condition that CCFL would remove the adverse entries on his credit file, but these 
were not removed. So Mr M complained again to CCFL in March 2014, mainly about the fact 
that the adverse entries had not been removed. When CCFL did not provide a substantive 
response to his complaint, Mr M complained to this service in August 2014, seeking the 
removal of the adverse entries.
CCFL objected to the complaint being considered as it had been referred to us more than six 
months after it had issued its final response letter in 2011.
The adjudicator said that she could not consider the first part of Mr M’s complaint as it had 
been referred to this service out of time. The adjudicator did not recommend that the second 
part of the complaint should be upheld. She said that she could not safely conclude that 
CCFL’s agent had agreed to remove the adverse information.
Mr M disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that the time limit for raising his 
complaint with this service started again when CCFL referred to his complaint rights in its 
letter dated 30 June 2014. He also said that he had sent CCFL’s agent a letter to confirm its 
agreement to remove all the adverse entries on his credit file as a condition to settling his 
account. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here), I 
reach my decision on the balance of probabilities – in other words, what I consider is most 
likely to have happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.

The loan agreement dispute
I can see that Mr M’s first complaint to CCFL in 2010 was predominantly about the loan 
agreement dispute. CCFL gave Mr M four complaint responses about the dispute from July 
2010 to September 2011 and it also gave him details of his complaint rights to this service. 
Each letter explained to Mr M that he had to complain within six months and enclosed a 
leaflet about his complaint rights. 
The rules under which we operate provide that, where a financial business objects, we 
cannot consider a complaint which is referred to us more than six months after the date on 
which the business sends the complainant its final response letter, advising him that they 
may refer the complaint to this service. In this case, CCFL sent its last final response letter to 
Mr M’s initial complaint about the loan agreement dispute in September 2011. For this 
service to be able to consider this aspect of Mr M’s complaint, we would have needed to 
receive his complaint form by 5 March 2012. I also note that CCFL has also objected to this 
complaint being considered out of time. 
Mr M said that the time limit for raising his complaint with this service started again when 
CCFL referred to his complaint rights in its letter dated 30 June 2014. I disagree. The 2014 
complaint is predominantly about the removal of adverse entries from Mr M’s credit file, and 
in my view, a different complaint from the one he raised in 2010.
I do not know why Mr M did not complain to this service before 5 March 2012. But because 
he did not do so, I agree with the adjudicator that we are unable to consider this aspect of 
his complaint. I appreciate that my decision will disappoint Mr M. However, I do not have a 
free hand to investigate every complaint. I am entirely bound by the rules and I am unable to 
disregard them.
The removal of adverse entries from Mr M’s credit file
Loan providers are under an obligation to reflect a borrower’s payment record on his credit 
file. The credit file should be a true and accurate reflection of the account in question. 
I can see that CCFL asked Mr M in its complaint response letters in 2010 and 2011 to 
reinstate his direct debit instruction. But because he did not do so, his monthly payments 
were not made. As Mr M did not make his repayments, the entries on his credit file reflected 
this. Mr M said that a default had been applied to his credit file, but I have seen no evidence 
of this on his credit file. CCFL has also informed this service that the account was not 
defaulted. So the only adverse entries on Mr M’s credit file show late/missed payments. 
Mr M said that it was a condition of his agreement to settle his account that the adverse 
entries on his file would be removed. I note that this agreement was made by telephone with 
CCFL’s debt collection agent, V. V wrote to Mr M on the date of the telephone conversation 
in mid-January 2014 and said:-
“Provided that we receive the specified payments by the due dates, we will write off the 
remaining balance. We will then notify the credit agencies that we have written off the 
remaining balance on the account and that it is settled.”
There is nothing in the letter about adverse entries being removed. If this had been agreed, I 
would have expected to see reference to it in the letter. CCFL said that its collection agents 
would not have had the authority to agree this in any event. 
Ref:

DRN7078434

I note that Mr M said that he had written to CCFL to confirm that the adverse entries would 
be removed. Neither he nor CCFL has a copy of the letter. If Mr M had disagreed with the 
contents of V’s letter in mid-January 2014, he could have raised the matter with CCFL or V 
to ensure that he had the confirmation before paying the £500 at the end of the month. I 
have not seen any evidence that he did so. So, having carefully considered the 
circumstances of this complaint, on balance, I do not consider that I have the grounds to 
require CCFL to remove the adverse entries from Mr M’s credit file. I appreciate that Mr M 
will be unhappy with my decision. However, he is not bound by it. If he does not wish to 
accept my decision, his legal rights remain intact.
my final decision
My decision is:-
1.
I am unable to consider Mr M’s first complaint about the loan agreement dispute as it 
does not fall within my jurisdiction; and
2.
I do not uphold Mr M’s second complaint about the removal of adverse entries from 
his credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2015.

complaint
Mrs Y complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) mis-sold her a loan 
payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Mrs Y took out the PPI policy with a loan when she bought some electrical goods in 
November 2007. Creation said that the sale took place in the store, and that it didn’t advise 
Mrs Y to take out the PPI. She borrowed £626.99 for the goods, and the PPI cost an 
additional £204.42. This was a single premium PPI policy, so the cost was added to the loan.
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. So if Mrs Y repaid the loan within that 
time she wouldn’t pay interest. After that the loan was set to be repaid over 36 months. The 
monthly payments included the PPI premium and a further £182.21 in interest on the 
premium. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mrs Y’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And she didn’t think Mrs Y would have bought the policy if it 
had.
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mrs Y was given would 
have made her aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mrs Y’s complaint. This is because I agree with the adjudicator that 
Creation didn’t properly tell Mrs Y how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mrs Y to work it out 
for herself. She was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

There was a ‘statement of price’ which did set out the interest. But it was on page two of 
the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where I think Mrs Y would expect it to be. 
And I can’t be sure it was drawn to her attention, particularly when she was in a store 
and her attention was on buying electrical items – not insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mrs Y better understand what the policy was costing her.  

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mrs Y aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If she didn’t 
repay the loan within the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted 
interest at 29.8%. This meant Mrs Y would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on 
the PPI cost for the first year. But the only benefit she gained was ‘free’ life cover. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7137145
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mrs Y was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mrs Y would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy - especially as she was borrowing a modest amount for non-essential items. 
Overall I don’t think Mrs Y would have bought the policy if she‘d been made properly aware 
of how much it was going to cost her. So I uphold Mrs Y’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mrs Y borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so her loan was higher than it should have been 
and she paid more than she should have done each month. So she needs to get back the 
extra she has paid. 
So Creation should:

work out and pay Mrs Y the difference between what she paid each month on the 
loan and what she would have paid each month without PPI;

add simple interest to the extra amount Mrs Y paid each month from when she paid it 
until she gets it back (the rate of interest is 8% a year†);

if Mrs Y made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can deduct what 
Mrs Y received from what’s due to her.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to deduct tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mrs Y a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’ve decided to uphold Mrs Y’s complaint. Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd must pay her the compensation I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs Y to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 January 2015.

K822x
complaint
Mr B complains about an alarm system he got using finance from Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd. He says the business didn’t fulfil its contractual obligations regarding the 
maintenance and monitoring of the alarm system. 
background 
Mr B bought the alarm system in March 2009. He took out a loan with Creation to pay for it. 
Mr B says the business he bought the system from went into liquidation in 2011. So the 
system hasn’t been maintained since then. He brings his complaint under Section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974.
At first Creation said that monitoring and maintenance wasn’t included in the credit 
agreement Mr B entered into. But it offered him a 25% reduction in the amount he needed to 
pay under the agreement as a gesture of goodwill. But our adjudicator said that the invoice 
Mr B was given referred to “15 years free monitoring and maintenance”. And he could also 
see that in 2011 the business he bought the system from wrote to him to say that said that it 
would find another company to honour all contracts for monitoring services. So he thought 
that the monitoring service did form part of the contract Mr B entered into. As that part of the 
contract hasn’t been honoured, our adjudicator thought Creation should terminate the 
agreement and pay for any service and monitoring charges Mr B has incurred since March 
2011 if he can provide evidence to show what he paid. 
Creation agreed to our adjudicator’s recommendation. But Mr B didn’t. His representative 
said the alarm doesn’t work any longer and hadn’t done for at least 3 years. An engineer 
was called out in the past and told Mr B that the battery was virtually dead. And the alarm 
isn’t connected to the phone line any longer as Mr B changed provider.
Mr B’s representative says that because Mr B didn’t receive a monitoring and maintenance 
service there has been a breach of contract. So it thinks Mr B is entitled to rescind his 
contract and be put in the position he would’ve been in hadn’t entered into the contract. In 
other words, it thinks Mr B should be refunded the money he has paid under the agreement 
with interest. And it wants any outstanding balance written off. Our adjudicator didn’t think 
this would be fair. So I’ve been asked to review this complaint.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
There’s no longer any dispute that monitoring and maintenance of the alarm system was 
covered by the contract Mr B entered into in 2009. Nor is there any dispute that part of the 
contract wasn’t honoured after the business he bought the system from went into liquidation 
in 2011. But that doesn’t mean that the relevant term of agreement was breached from the 
start. Mr B had around three years’ use of the system before the business closed in 2011. 
So I don’t think it would be fair and reasonable for Mr B to get back all the money he paid 
under the agreement, with interest.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7160174
--------------------------

2
As I think Mr B’s contract was breached in 2011 and it isn’t due to end until February 2019, 
I’ve considered whether it would be fair to require Creation to cancel the contract and 
reimburse Mr B for the payments he has made towards the contract since the date of the 
breach. But despite the breach, I think Mr B has benefited from the system since 2011. At 
the end of September 2016 (around three months after the complaint was first raised with 
us) Mr B’s representative told us that the alarm system hasn’t worked for at least 3 years 
because the battery needed replacing. There’s no indication that it didn’t work before this. 
And it doesn’t look as though Mr B has acted to get the battery replaced. I find this 
surprising. I think it’s likely that if the alarm wasn’t working and he was still paying for it, Mr B 
would’ve mentioned this sooner.
In the circumstances, I don’t think Mr B’s alarm is faulty. There may be an issue with the 
battery. But I think a new battery could be fitted to the system quite quickly and easily. Mr B’s 
representative also says that Mr B’s alarm isn’t linked to his phone line any longer as Mr B 
changed phone provider. But I don’t think Creation is responsible for linking up his new 
phone line to the system given that Mr B chose to change his phone provider.
To put matters right, I think Creation should cancel Mr B’s agreement and write off the rest of 
what he owes. It should record the agreement as settled on Mr B’s credit file. That’s because 
I think the contract has been breached, and given that another provider hasn’t been put in 
place to monitor and maintain Mr B’s alarm, it will remain in breach until it ends in 2019. The 
upshot of this is that Mr B won’t owe Creation any more money under the contract. And he 
can still choose to get the battery fixed and get the alarm linked up to his new phone line if 
he wants to use the alarm in the future. If Mr B does this he can arrange for another 
business to monitor and maintain it.
Creation has said that it is happy with the resolution. But Mr B’s representative isn’t. It says 
that Mr B paid money for a service he didn’t receive. So therefore, it’s only fair and 
reasonable that he should be reimbursed for the money he has paid already plus interest. 
But I disagree for the reasons set out above.
my final decision
My final decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should cancel Mr B’s loan, write off 
the remaining money owed under it, and record it as settled on Mr B’s credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2016.

K821x#12
complaint
Mrs V complains that she was mis-sold two single premium policies which provided life, 
hospitalisation and personal accident cover by Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”). 
Mrs V was sold the first policy when taking out a loan from Creation in 2007. The term of the 
loan and the policy were both five years. The premium for the policy was added to Mrs V’s 
loan.
Mrs V was sold the second policy a year later, in 2008, when she took out a new loan to 
repay the 2007 loan and increase her borrowing. The term of the new loan was seven years 
while the term of the new policy was five years. Again, the premium for the policy was added 
to Mrs V’s loan.
background
The last adjudicator who considered this case concluded that the complaint should be 
upheld because Creation didn’t do enough to make clear to Mrs V the costs of both policies, 
the optional nature of the 2007 policy and the restrictive cancellation terms of the 
2008 policy. Creation does not agree with the adjudicator’s view and so the matter has been 
referred to me for a decision.
my findings
I have provided only a brief summary of the complaint above but, in reaching my decision, 
I have carefully considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this case. I have also taken account of any relevant 
regulatory rules, the law and good industry practice at the time the policies were sold. 
Although the policies Mrs V took out were not “traditional” payment protection insurance 
(“PPI”) policies, which usually involve the provision of accident, sickness and/or 
unemployment cover, I think the relevant considerations in this case are materially the same 
as those set out in our well-established general approach to complaints about the sale of 
PPI, which is published on our website. The key questions I need to consider therefore are:

whether, in giving any advice, Creation took adequate steps to ensure that the products 
it recommended were suitable for Mrs V’s needs; and 

whether Creation gave Mrs V information that was clear, fair and not misleading in order 
to put her in a position where she could make an informed choice about the insurances 
she was buying.
If Creation did something wrong when selling the policies, I need to consider whether Mrs V 
would have done anything differently – ie not taken them out – if it had not done so.
did Creation recommend the policies to Mrs V?
Mrs V says Creation gave her advice and recommended the policies to her. Creation says it 
did not give advice or make recommendations but gave her information so that she could 
decide for herself whether or not the policies were suitable.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7168603
--------------------------

2
The sale of both policies took place over the telephone. Creation has been unable to provide 
us with recordings of the sales calls. It has, however, given us copies of the telephone sales 
scripts which it says would have been followed for each of the sales. Although I don’t know 
the extent to which they were followed for Mrs V’s sales, I think they give me a broad 
indication of the likely structure and content of the calls. There is nothing in the scripts that 
makes me think Mrs V was given a specific recommendation in either case. 
Also, the documentation I have seen which Creation says Mrs V would have been sent in the 
post after the sales also indicates that they were non-advised.
So, on balance, I am persuaded Creation did not advise Mrs V to take out the policies. 
Therefore, it did not have to assess their suitability for Mrs V’s needs. However, it did have to 
provide her with information about the cover that was clear, fair and not misleading so that 
she could make a proper and fully informed decision about whether to take them out.
I am not satisfied that Creation did so in this case and it is on this point that I intend to focus.
were Mrs V’s information needs about the cost of the policies made clear?
I am not satisfied that Creation clearly presented the cost of either of the policies to Mrs V. 
These are significant failings for reasons I’ll explain in more detail below.
As I have already said, both sales took place over the telephone and, although there are no 
call recordings, Creation has given us the call scripts it says would have been used. I have 
looked at these carefully. 
For the 2007 policy, all the sales script says is: “If you are passed for the credit amount that 
you have applied for, the monthly repayment amounts will be; (INCLUDED QUOTE WITH 
PAYMENT PROTECTION AND WITHOUT)”. 
There is nothing in the script to suggest Mrs V would have been told how much the policy 
premium was going to cost her (this was over £1400). There is also nothing in it to suggest 
Mrs V would have been told what the interest on that premium would be if the loan and the 
policy ran its full term (this was over £360) or what the total cost of the product would be (this 
was nearly £1800, out of a total borrowing of just over £11,000). And to work out the monthly 
cost of the insurance (which I understand was almost £30), she would have had to do some 
mental arithmetic by deducting the quote for the monthly repayment with the insurance 
which it seems she would have been given from the quote for the monthly repayment without 
it. And she would have had to do this while Creation’s representative was also talking to her 
on the telephone. This is not something that it is reasonable to expect a consumer to do, 
especially when the main reason for their call is to arrange a personal loan, rather than to 
take out an insurance product.
For the 2008 policy, all the script says is: “The monthly repayment amounts would be 
[include quotes with payment protection and without payment protection and also advise 
the customer of total cost of the payment protection policy]”. 
It does appear in this instance that Mrs V would have been give information on the total cost 
of the policy. But, again, there is nothing to suggest that the cost of the policy premium 
(more than £3200), the interest on that premium (almost £1200) and the monthly cost of the 
policy (which I understand was over £50) were made clear to her.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7168603
--------------------------

3
It was Creation’s responsibility in both of these sales to draw Mrs V’s attention to the most 
important information about the policy that was likely to affect her decision-making. And one 
of the most important considerations for any consumer – and I have no reason to believe it 
would be any different for Mrs V – is to understand the cost of the insurance they are buying. 
This is especially so when the policy being sold is a single premium policy. 
Single premium policies are paid for in a very different way to most other insurance policies. 
In particular, their cost structure is different. The cost of the premium is added to the 
underlying loan which attracts interest. And the initial premium cost is often significantly 
increased by that interest, as it is added to it over the term of the loan. In Mrs V’s case, 
interest increased her 2007 and 2008 policy costs by about 25% and about 37%, 
respectively.
None of this is a straightforward way to fund insurance and it is not something that Mrs V is 
likely to have had much understanding of. Nor was she in a position where she was likely to 
appreciate that single premium policies can often be an expensive way of paying to cover, 
especially when compared to the more familiar and perhaps easier to understand regular 
premium policies.
It is in the light of these considerations that, in Mrs V’s case, I believe the failure to disclose 
clearly key information about the cost of the policies when she took them out over the 
telephone was such a significant one.
Following the telephone conversations in which the policies were sold, Mrs V was sent a 
number of documents, including a credit agreement, which she was to sign and return to 
Creation, and a policy summary. 
The credit agreement for each policy includes details of the amount of the premium and the 
total cost of the policy. However, neither sets out separately the amount of the interest 
payable on the premium over the life of the loan. Nor do they state the monthly cost of the 
policy, which is something we might reasonably expect to see in a policy of this type. So, in 
the main financial documents, which Mrs V might reasonably expect to contain the important 
information she needed to know about her loans and her insurance, key pieces of financial 
information about the insurances were not included.
The policy summary for each policy includes a “Statement of Price”, which sets out the cost 
of the premium, the interest payable on it and the total cost of the insurance (though not the 
monthly cost). But it sets these details out at the very back of a document that Mrs V did not 
have to sign and to which she might therefore not have attached great significance when 
reviewing the documentation that was sent to her.
So, I do not think the documents Mrs V was sent after the sales took place provided 
adequate disclosure of all of the important information she should have had about what the 
insurance was going to cost her. When considering the information in these documents, I’ve 
also taken into account that Mrs V agreed to buy these policies over the telephone, even 
though she didn’t sign to accept the insurance until she got the credit agreements. So I don’t 
think she would have attached as much to them as to any information that was given to her 
during the sales calls. And, in accordance with general standards of good industry practice, 
documentation supplied after a sale has taken place – even if it is adequate (which, in this 
case, I don’t think it was) – is unlikely to correct failings in the actual sales process.

DRN7168603

did the failing to provide costs information result in a difference to Mrs V’s decisions?
Establishing clear (and significant) failings or flaws is not sufficient for me to uphold Mrs V’s 
complaint. I must also consider whether these failings would have made a difference to her 
decisions to purchase the policies.
I have no reason to believe that the cost of the cover Mrs V was purchasing wouldn’t have 
been important to her. I am persuaded that had she been told in a clear and fair way that:

in the case of the 2007 policy, for life, hospitalisation and personal accident cover, she 
would be paying a total of nearly £1,800, at a rate of nearly £30 per month for five years 
on a total borrowing of around £11,000; and

in the case of the 2008 policy for the same type of cover, she would be paying a total of 
nearly £4,500 at a rate of over £50 per month for seven years (even though the policy 
only ran for five years) on a total borrowing of around £25,000,
she would not have taken them out.
It follows from this that I do not think Creation met Mrs V’s information needs. And I think that 
with better and clearer information about the cost of the policies, Mrs V is likely to have 
declined them. For these reasons, I uphold her complaint.
other information failings
I have upheld Mrs V’s complaint primarily because of Creation’s failure to adequately 
disclose the cost of the policies to her. But I will add that I also have concerns that Creation 
failed to disclose other important information about the policies as follows:

In relation to the sale of the 2007 policy, and having looked carefully at the call script 
Creation says would have been followed, I have not seen anything to suggest that Mrs V 
was informed that the policy was optional. Nor have I seen anything in the script to 
suggest that Creation requested her consent to taking out the policy. So my concern is 
that Mrs V was not given an opportunity to exercise a choice about whether or not she 
wanted to take out the policy.

In relation to the sale of the 2008 policy, and, again, having looked carefully at the script 
Creation says would have been followed, I have not seen anything to suggest that Mrs V 
was informed of the potential financial impact the policy’s restrictive cancellation terms 
might have had on her. The policy did not offer a pro-rata refund if it was cancelled early. 
This means that Mrs V would not have received a refund of premiums that matched the 
time left to run on the policy if she cancelled it.
Mrs V was using her 2008 loan in part to refinance the 2007 one, so there is a strong 
chance that she might have wanted the flexibility to consolidate her debts and refinance 
again at some point in the future. A restriction such as the one contained in the 
2008 policy, which is likely to have made Mrs V’s ability to re-finance the loan less easy 
or more costly, may have impacted on her decision to buy it.

Also in relation to the 2008 loan, I have not seen anything in the script to suggest Mrs V 
would have been made aware that, while her new loan was due to run for seven years, 
the policy only ran for five years. So Mrs V would have needed to incur further costs to 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7168603
--------------------------

5
maintain similar cover for the full duration of the loan (while still paying for the policy 
under the 2008 loan arrangements). And any claim on the 2008 policy could have found 
her excluded under any subsequent policy taken out. Had Mrs V been informed of this, 
again, it might have impacted on her decision to take out the policy.
successive sales
Before I turn to appropriate compensation, it is worthwhile briefly setting out that the 
2008 policy sale was a ‘successive sale’. So, it seems that, when Mrs V increased her 
borrowing in 2008, instead of setting up a new loan running alongside the earlier loan, 
Creation set up one new loan, incorporating and settling the 2007 loan. 
I understand this meant that the five year policy purchased with the 2007 loan was 
cancelled, with Creation selling a new policy in 2008. Appropriate compensation will require 
consideration of the fact that the 2008 lending may have incorporated the residual cost of the 
2007 policy.
fair compensation
I think that, if Mrs V hadn’t bought the policies, she would still have gone ahead with the 
loans. Therefore, she should be put back in the position she would have been in if the 
policies hadn’t been sold. The 2008 policy had a five year term, so I presume it has run its 
course but that the 2008 loan is still running. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:
(A)
In respect of each loan:

recalculate the loan and the payments to what they would have been if Mrs V had 
taken the loan without the insurance policies; 

repay to Mrs V the amounts by which the payments actually made exceeded the 
recalculated payments;

pay Mrs V interest on each of these amounts at 8% per year simple† from the date 
each payment was made to the date the compensation is paid;

recalculate the balance that would have been outstanding at the end of each loan 
had the recalculated loan not included the insurance policies.
(B) 
Calculate how much of the balance that was carried forward to the subsequent loan 
related to the cost of the insurance policy taken out for the previous loan; and

repay to Mrs V all amounts paid under each subsequent loan in respect of the carried

Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should allow this. But it cannot require Mrs V to reduce the 
loan to less than it would be now had Mrs V not bought the insurance policies.
† I understand Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is required to deduct basic rate tax from this 
part of the compensation. Whether Mrs V needs to take any further action will depend on her 
financial circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our 
website.
Mrs V should refer back to Creation Consumer Finance Ltd if she is unsure of the approach 
it has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know 
more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.

For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mrs V’s complaint and require 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to pay Mrs V fair compensation in accordance with the 
calculation I have set out above.

complaint
Ms W complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) is seeking to enforce a 
loan agreement against her that she didn’t sign.
background
In February 2015, Ms W set up business in partnership with a third party whom I’ll call “T”. 
Ms W says that T wanted to buy some flooring for the business from a firm I’ll call “D”. T 
couldn’t get finance for the flooring in her own name. So Ms W said she would act as 
guarantor to get the finance on the basis that T would pay all the instalments.
It appears that T paid the first instalment and then defaulted. Shortly afterwards, the 
partnership broke up and, with Ms W’s agreement, T continued the business on her own.   
Ms W then discovered that the loan for the flooring was in her sole name, and Creation 
asked her to meet the instalments. Ms W said she hadn’t signed, or received a copy of, any 
loan agreement with Creation, so shouldn’t have to repay the loan.
Our adjudicator didn’t recommend that this complaint should be upheld. Ms W had clearly 
been involved with the purchase of the flooring from D. Her signature was on a cost and 
measurement document, even though she said she wasn’t party to any contract with D. And 
she was also aware of the loan from Creation and intended to act as guarantor for this.
Creation had explained that it didn’t offer guaranteed loans. Its records showed that Ms W 
had signed a loan agreement in her sole name electronically. To do this, she would have to 
have signed a copy on a screen using a stylus, or clicked on her name on a computer, on 
D’s premises. D would also have given her a hard copy of the agreement on its premises or 
emailed a copy to her.
Creation’s records also showed that Ms W had contacted it twice, first to give authority to T 
on the account, and secondly to change the bank direct debit details for the loan 
repayments.
So the adjudicator thought Ms W was aware of, and had signed, the loan agreement and so 
was liable for the repayments. Even if she had only signed as guarantor, she would still be 
fully liable along with T. We couldn’t go into technical issues of whether the loan agreement 
was enforceable or not – that was the role of the courts. The adjudicator couldn’t say that 
Creation was acting unreasonably in seeking repayment from Ms W.
Ms W responded to say, in summary, that she hadn’t signed the loan agreement, physically 
or electronically. If she had merely been a guarantor, T would have had some liability also, 
which would have put some pressure on her. She asked for her complaint to be reviewed.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms W doesn’t now recollect signing any document in favour of Creation, either physically or 
electronically. It isn’t possible now to know for certain all that happened between Ms W, T, 
and D in relation to the purchase of the flooring and the arrangement of the loan from 
Creation. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7237530
--------------------------

2
Creation’s records show that Ms W contacted it twice about the loan. And I think it’s most 
likely that she did sign the loan agreement electronically intending to become liable for 
repayment of the loan, even if only as guarantor. As a result, Creation paid the purchase 
price for the flooring to D.
So all in all I can’t say that it’s unreasonable for Creation to seek to recover the loan from  
Ms W.
my final decision
My decision is that I don’t uphold this complaint, and make no order against Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 September 2016.

complaint
Mr U complains about a single premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy sold to 
him in February 2005 by Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. 
The policy was sold with a fixed-sum loan. It provided life, accident, sickness and 
unemployment cover. Mr U says the policy was mis-sold.
background
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint be upheld. He didn’t think Creation had done 
enough to make Mr U aware of the total cost of the policy, the interest charged on it, or the 
effect this would have on his monthly loan repayments. And he didn’t think Mr U would have 
bought the policy if he had been made properly aware of these things. 
Creation disagreed. It said it gave Mr U enough information about the cost of the policy; and 
also to make him aware interest was charged on it. It said it couldn’t be held responsible if 
Mr U chose not to read that information, or chose not to query anything he was unsure of. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. In doing so, I have taken into account any 
relevant regulatory rules and guidance, as well as the law and good industry practice when 
the policy was sold.
We’ve been looking at complaints about the sale of PPI for several years now. And we have 
a well-established approach, which is published on our website. I think the relevant 
considerations in this case are materially the same as our published approach. 
Broadly speaking, what I need to consider here is:

whether Creation gave advice and, if it did, whether it took adequate steps to ensure the 
policy was suitable for Mr U’s needs; 

whether Creation gave Mr U information which was clear, fair and not misleading so he 
could make an informed choice about the policy he was buying; and

if there were faults with the way Creation sold the policy, whether Mr U is worse off as a 
result (in other words would he have done something different – such as not buy the 
policy – but for any shortcomings?).
did Creation recommend the policy to Mr U?
Creation says this sale took place on a non-advised basis. And it has provided some 
paperwork to support that assertion; including a key facts document containing a policy 
summary and statement of price. These documents suggest that Creation didn’t give Mr U 
any specific recommendation. 
Mr U told us he can’t remember whether he was given advice or not. He says he felt 
pressured to buy the policy and wasn’t given any information about it. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7249072
--------------------------

2
On the available evidence I don’t think Creation advised Mr U to buy the policy. So it didn’t 
have to take steps to ensure the policy was suitable for him. But it did have to give Mr U 
enough information to allow him to make an informed choice about the policy he was buying. 
did Creation give Mr U enough information – and did it make a difference if not?
It’s here I think Creation failed to live up to its responsibilities towards Mr U, because I find 
that it failed to properly disclose the total cost of the policy and also the interest charged on 
it. And I find that, if Mr U had known that information, he wouldn’t have bought the policy. 
When explaining why I’ve come to my findings I think it’s important to first consider the 
context in which the PPI sale took place. Mr U was in a shop, buying a DVD player and 
accessories costing a little over £150. It’s reasonable to assume that his focus would have 
been on choosing the right goods for his needs; not on buying insurance to protect any 
finance he might have chosen to take out to pay for those goods. It’s likely there was a lot 
going on at the point of sale. And Mr U says nothing was explained to him about the policy. 
Creation should have ensured that Mr U’s attention was drawn to the important information 
about the policy which would be likely to affect his decision making. One of the most 
important features was the total cost of the policy, including the interest that would be 
charged on it. This is especially so given that this was a single premium policy. 
Single premium PPI policies are paid for in a very different way to most other insurance 
products. In particular, their cost structure is different – because the initial premium cost is 
often significantly increased by the interest added to it over the term of the loan. This is not a 
straightforward way to fund insurance and is not something Mr U was likely to have much 
understanding of. Nor was he likely to be in a position to appreciate that single premium 
policies can often be an expensive way of paying for cover over the more familiar and 
perhaps easier to understand regular premium policy. 
In the case of the policy sold to Mr U, the premium cost £62.71. The interest on that 
premium was £77.01. So the interest on the premium more than doubled the total cost of the 
policy and – proportionally speaking – was substantially higher than the cost of the policy 
alone. 
I think this was an unusual aspect of this policy and something Mr U is unlikely to have 
expected. And I have no reason to doubt that Mr U would have considered this to be 
important information, in the context that he was buying non-essential goods of very modest 
cost. And also in the context that the total cost of the PPI was almost as much as the base 
cost of the goods he was buying. 
Creation says it did bring the interest to Mr U’s attention. Firstly it says the credit agreement 
set out both the initial premium cost and also the total amount payable (the cost of the 
goods, the PPI premium and the total interest charged on them both). Secondly it says Mr U 
would have seen the key facts document, which included a statement of price. The 
statement of price set out the cost of the policy and the interest payable on it separately; as 
well as the total cost of the PPI (premium and interest together).
I don’t agree with Creation’s arguments. 
I say this firstly because the credit agreement was the main finance document and Mr U 
could reasonably expect it to contain the important financial information he needed to know. 
But the credit agreement didn’t show the total cost of the PPI. Nor did it show the 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7249072
--------------------------

3
PPI interest as a separate figure. It did show the total interest charged; but this was the 
interest on the credit for the goods and the PPI premium combined. 
Mr U would find it very difficult to work out, from the information in the credit agreement, 
what portion of the interest charge applied only to the PPI premium. And that’s if he first 
understood that interest was being charged on the PPI at all. The information in the credit 
agreement didn’t make that clear. So I’m not satisfied that this information was drawn to 
Mr U’s attention in a clear and prominent way. 
The statement of price was on page two of a document titled “Open + Direct CreditCover 
Life, Accident, Sickness and Unemployment Payment Protection Insurance Policy 
Summary”. Nothing in the title of this document suggested it would contain important 
information about the cost of the policy. It also didn’t make Mr U aware that he must look at 
the second page to find out that interest was being charged on his PPI premium – and how 
much that would be. That wasn’t a prominent location. And I find it unlikely that Mr U would 
have expected to find that information in that location. Yet this was the only document which 
showed the PPI interest as a separate figure, or made clear that interest was being charged 
at all. 
The policy summary also didn’t require Mr U to sign to show he had read or received it. 
So I can’t be sure Mr U even saw this document, or that Creation brought it clearly to his 
attention at the point of sale. Even if he did see it, I’m not persuaded Mr U would have 
realised that it contained important information about the cost of the policy over and above 
what he would reasonably have expected to find in the credit agreement itself. Given that he 
didn’t have to sign the policy summary, I also don’t find it likely that Mr U would have given it 
the same level of attention he might have given to the credit agreement – which he did have 
to sign. 
I also note that none of the documents showed the monthly cost of the policy. The monthly 
payments to the loan (including the PPI) were a little over £10, so I realise that the monthly 
cost of the PPI was likely to be low. However, telling Mr U the separate monthly cost of the 
PPI would have better helped him to understand the cost of it relative to what he was 
spending on the goods he was buying. As a matter of good industry practice this is 
information I might reasonably expect to see in relation to this type of policy. 
Creation says the onus was on Mr U to review the information given and ask for further 
information if he didn’t understand something. That isn’t correct. It was Creation’s 
responsibility to give Mr U enough information about the main features and benefits of the 
policy to enable him to make an informed choice. 
For the reasons given above I find that Creation failed to meet its responsibilities when it 
sold this policy to Mr U, as it didn’t make him properly aware of the cost of the policy. Had 
Mr U been given clearer information – and in the context that he was borrowing a modest 
sum where his monthly payments without the policy would have been very small – I think 
Mr U would be unlikely to have seen the policy as offering any real value to him. I find that 
Mr U wouldn’t have bought the policy, but for Creation’s failing.
Finally (and whilst I’ve already decided to uphold this complaint for the reasons given 
above), I’ll add that I am also concerned about the way the ‘buy now pay later’ period was 
explained in the documents. 
During the 12-month buy now pay later period Mr U would qualify for life cover under the 
policy. If he repaid the cost of the goods before the end date he wouldn’t pay any interest on 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7249072
--------------------------

4
the credit for the goods, or anything for the PPI. But, if he didn’t repay in the buy now pay 
later period, interest would be calculated from the date of the agreement. The whole balance 
outstanding (including the PPI premium) would be accruing interest at 32.4%. 
I understand that Mr U didn’t repay within the deferred period. So he would have paid a 
substantial (relative to the sums involved here) additional amount in interest on the single 
premium PPI policy in the first year. The only benefit he gained was what was described as 
‘free’ life cover. 
I have taken into consideration that the credit agreement did set out how interest would be 
calculated. However, I’m not satisfied that this information was enough to make Mr U aware 
of the implications of how the buy now pay later period would affect the interest payable on 
the PPI premium. This compounds the cost disclosure failing I have already set out above.
fair redress
I find that, if Mr U hadn’t bought the PPI policy, he would still have gone ahead with the loan. 
So he should be put back in the position he would have been in if the PPI policy hadn’t been 
sold. The loan and the PPI policy had a term of five years (including the buy now pay later 
period) so should by now have run their course. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should therefore:
A.
Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr U because PPI was 
added to the loan by:
•
calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr U had taken out the 
loan without PPI;
•
subtracting those amounts from what Mr U actually paid and paying him the 
difference; and
•
paying Mr U interest (simple, not compound) on each of these amounts at the rate of 
8% a year from the date each payment was made to the date the redress is paid†.
B.
Write to Mr U to set out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is required to deduct basic rate tax from this 
part of the compensation. Whether Mr U needs to take any further action will depend on his 
financial circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our 
website.
Mr U should refer back to Creation Consumer Finance Ltd if he is unsure of the approach it 
has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know 
more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Mr U compensation calculated in accordance with the instructions set out above 
under ‘fair redress’.

complaint
Mrs S complains that the furniture she obtained through a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited is not of satisfactory quality.
background
Before Mrs S signed the loan agreement, she says she asked the salesperson whether there 
would be any dye transfer from clothing to the furniture. She was told to use a particular 
product which would stop any dye transfer and, on this basis, she went ahead with the 
agreement. Around five months later she complained that the colour of the furniture had 
faded and a month after that she complained that dye from clothing had transferred onto the 
furniture, even though she had used the recommended product.
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She concluded that the 
furniture provided was not as described and not of satisfactory quality, as evidenced by the 
independent report paid for by Mrs S. She thought Creation should remove the furniture free 
of charge, terminate the agreement with no further payments due, pay Mrs S £50 to cover 
the cost of the independent report and pay her £200 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused.
Creation responded by paying for its own independent report which said, in summary, that 
the furniture was free from defects and that the discolouration was caused by dye transfer, 
not by any fault with the furniture itself.
 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, Mrs S has the right to claim against 
Creation, as the provider of credit, for a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier of the furniture.
Each party to this complaint has arranged its own independent report. Some aspects of the 
reports are contradictory. One says “the overall condition of the furniture’s finish and colour 
are free from defects”; whereas the other says that there is “scaring” to the seats due to the 
use of “uncorrected hides” and that “there is some fading on some of the leather surfaces on 
the arms in particular“.
But both reports are in agreement that the furniture has discoloured due to dye transfer from 
non-colour fast items of clothing and/or soft furnishings. Mrs S says she was worried about 
dye from clothing transferring to the furniture so she discussed this with the salesperson 
before signing the loan agreement. I consider she would not have signed the agreement 
unless she had received strong reassurance that there would not be a problem, provided 
she used the recommended product. So, although the defect is not due to the quality of the 
furniture itself, I conclude that there was a misrepresentation at the point of sale and that 
Mrs S has a valid claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. It follows she should 
be put back in the position she would have been in had she not signed the agreement. 
I consider the furniture should be removed and the agreement terminated. Mrs S has had 
use of the furniture so I don’t think it fair that any payments she has already made should be 
refunded. But she should be refunded for the cost of the report. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7259874
--------------------------

2
Creation is not liable for any trouble and upset caused because the furniture was 
misrepresented by the salesperson. But I think Mrs S should be compensated for the delay 
in concluding her complaint caused by Creation arranging two inspections of the furniture, 
the first of which took around two hours. Creation did not supply a report following this first 
inspection. I consider £200 compensation to be reasonable in the circumstances.
my final decision
For the reasons I have explained, my decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Limited 
should:
1.
Remove the furniture, at no cost to Mrs S.
2.
Terminate the agreement, with no further payments being due.
3.
Pay Mrs S £50 to compensate her for the cost of the independent report.
4.
Pay Mrs S £200 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs S to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 June 2015.

complaint
Mr C complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) failed to tell him that his loan 
was in arrears. He is also unhappy about the way it reported his account to the credit 
reference agencies.
background
In January 2011, Mr C took out a loan with Creation. He missed the first few months 
payments and as a result arrears accrued on the account. In July 2011, Mr C set up a direct 
debit to pay off the loan and he continued to make payments until the loan finished and the 
arrears were cleared in October 2014.
When he later accessed his credit file, he discovered the account had been reported as 
being in arrears for the lifetime of the loan. Mr C said he had not been aware that the 
account had remained in arrears as he thought the monthly direct debit had brought the loan 
up to date. He said Creation should have done more to notify him that this was not the case. 
Mr C said this has had a negative impact on his ability to obtain credit. 
He complained to Creation. It agreed to amend the fifth month of the loan to show it had 
been four months in arrears rather than ‘unclassified’. But it said it was right to report the 
remaining years of the loan as consistently three months in arrears as this was an accurate 
reflection of how he had managed the account. 
He asked us to look at his complaint. Our adjudicator did not think Creation had acted 
unfairly. 
Mr C did not agree and so asked for an ombudsman’s decision. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Creation said although the loan was taken out in January 2011 no payments were received 
until July 2011. It said the initial direct debit had been cancelled by Mr C. And although a 
one-off payment was made in July 2011 and a direct debit was then set up, this did not clear 
the arrears/charges and so they were carried forward to the end of the agreement. As a 
direct debit had been set up - no further letters about the arrears were triggered. And it 
reported to the credit reference agencies that the loan had been in arrears throughout. It said 
this was an accurate reflection of the account. 
I acknowledge what Mr C has told us about changing his bank account at the beginning of 
the loan and that he couldn’t fully recall the direct debit being cancelled. But the onus was on 
him to make sure that the account was being properly maintained. He did contact Creation in 
July 2011 having received letters about the arrears. It sent us the most recent template of 
those letters (and it said the information has remained largely unchanged). I can see they 
warn that an account in arrears can be reported to the credit reference agencies. 
I have listened to the telephone call from July 2011 when Mr C made the first payment on 
the account. The direct debit was re-instated and Mr C paid £50 of the arrears (which 
including charges was around £300). Mr C said he could not pay all of the arrears at that 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7270538
--------------------------

2
time. It was made clear that the direct debit would not clear the arrears and a separate 
arrangement to pay was made to settle the arrears. It was agreed that Mr C would contact 
Creation to make a manual payment of £50 each month. It is clear Mr C did not stick to that 
payment plan. 
So overall, I think it should have been clear to Mr C that the arrears had not been brought up 
to date and therefore remained outstanding. And that the monthly direct debit would not 
bring the account back up to date. 
Mr C said Creation should have done more to notify him later on in the lifetime of the loan 
that the account was still in arrears. Creation accepts it did not write to Mr C again about the 
arrears until April 2014 after the loan had been due to finish. It said it would have sent him 
annual statements but it said they may not necessarily have shown the arrears. So I can’t be 
sure that the arrears were brought to his attention between July 2011 and April 2014. On 
balance, I think that they probably were not and I do think that Creation should have done 
something to bring the outstanding arrears to Mr C’s attention during that time. 
That said, the key question here is whether Mr C would have acted differently to address the 
arrears had Creation written to him again about them. I can see Mr C did not miss any of the 
remaining payments on the loan. And when he was sent the arrears letter in April 2014 he 
did contact it to make payment and over the course of the next six months cleared the 
outstanding arrears on the loan.
However, I note he failed to keep to the arrangement to pay set up in July 2011 to clear the 
arrears over six months. Presumably if he had been able to clear the arrears at that time he 
would have. And over the course of the last six months of the loan it seems that two 
repayment plans were broken, a direct debit returned, three default notices were sent and 
the debt was ultimately passed to a third party. 
Having carefully considered all of the circumstances, I think Creation gave Mr C an 
opportunity to clear the arrears by way of a repayment plan that he did not stick to in July 
2011. Nor did he get in touch with Creation after he had broken the plan. I think he struggled 
to clear the arrears in April 2014. And I don’t think he would have managed to pay the 
arrears in addition to his monthly payments during the lifetime of the loan. Ultimately, Mr C 
knew that the arrears still existed. The earlier letters sent to Mr C about the arrears made it 
clear that Creation would report the arrears to the credit reference agencies. On balance, 
I am not satisfied that Mr C would have cleared the arrears had Creation written to him in 
either 2012 or 2013 to remind him of them. 
Overall, although I recognise Mr C’s frustration, I don’t think I can reasonably direct Creation 
to change the information that it has recorded on his credit file.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2016.

complaint
Mr N complains that he was mis-sold a single premium payment protection insurance (“PPI”) 
policy by Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) which was taken out in connection 
with a loan to purchase a television in 2006. 
The PPI had a term of three years, which matched the term of the loan. Under the 
arrangements, 12 months’ free credit was offered. This meant the loan and PPI repayments 
were effectively deferred for 12 months. During this “special offer” period, the PPI policy 
offered life cover. After that, for the three years the finance would run if full payment for the 
goods was not made by the end of the special offer period, the policy provided cover for 
accident, sickness and unemployment, as well as life cover. 
Mr N is represented by a claims management company.
background
The adjudicator concluded that the complaint should be upheld because Creation didn’t do 
enough to make the cost of the policy clear to Mr N. Creation does not agree with the 
adjudicator’s view and so the matter has been referred to me for a decision.
my findings
I have provided only a brief summary of the complaint above but, in reaching my decision, 
I have carefully considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this case. I have also taken account of any relevant 
regulatory rules, the law and good industry practice at the time the PPI policy was sold. 
The relevant considerations in this case are materially the same as those set out in our well-
established general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI, which is published on our 
website. The key questions I need to consider therefore are:

whether, in giving any advice, Creation took adequate steps to ensure that the product it 
recommended was suitable for Mr N’s needs; and 

whether Creation gave Mr N information that was clear, fair and not misleading in order 
to put him in a position where he could make an informed choice about the insurance he 
was buying.
If Creation did something wrong when selling the policy, I need to consider whether Mr N 
would have acted differently if it had not done so.
did Creation recommend the policy to Mr N?
I understand this policy was sold during a meeting in a store when Mr N arranged the 
finance for his television. 
Mr N says Creation recommended the policy to him. Creation says it did not recommend the 
policy but gave him information so he could decide for himself whether the policy was 
suitable. Creation has provided some paperwork to support its position, including a key facts 
document and a policy summary which included a statement of price. These documents 
suggest that Creation didn’t give Mr N any specific recommendation. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7279384
--------------------------

2
So, on balance – and based on the available evidence – I am persuaded Creation did not 
advise Mr N to take out the policy. 
Therefore Creation did not have to assess the suitability of the policy for Mr N’s 
circumstances. However, it did have to provide him with information about the cover that was 
clear, fair and not misleading, so that he was able to make a proper and fully informed 
decision about whether to take out the policy. 
I am not satisfied that Creation did so in this case and it is on this point that I intend to focus. 
were Mr N’s information needs met?
I am not satisfied that Creation clearly presented the cost of the policy to Mr N. I think this is 
a significant failing for reasons I’ll explain in detail below. 
Essentially, though, I don’t think Creation explained clearly enough to Mr N how much 
interest he would pay on the PPI premium if the loan and the policy ran their full term.
I’ve reached my decision taking into account where and how the policy was sold and also 
the type of policy Mr N was sold – a single premium PPI policy. 
Mr N was in a shop, buying a television costing around £1400. It’s reasonable to assume 
that Mr N’s main focus would have been on choosing the television he wanted and not on 
buying insurance to protect any finance he was choosing to take out to pay for it. It’s likely 
there was a lot going on at the time and a lot for Mr N to think about. Only a limited amount 
of his attention was likely to have been given to the information about the policy. 
And Mr N was being sold a single premium PPI policy. These policies are paid for in a very 
different way to most other insurance products. In particular, the cost structure of the policy – 
how the policy’s up-front cost is often significantly increased because interest is added to it 
over the term of the loan – is different. This is not a straightforward way to fund insurance 
and it is not something Mr N was likely to have much understanding of. Nor was he likely to 
be in a position to appreciate that single premium policies can often be an expensive way of 
paying for cover over the more familiar and perhaps easier to understand regular premium 
policy. 
So, if some relevant information about the cost of the policy was not disclosed to Mr N – 
such as the amount of interest that would be payable on the premium he was paying for it – 
I think it follows the risk increases that he might not have a clear understanding of the policy. 
I’ll now turn to the specifics of the policy and how it was sold. 
The premium on the policy was around £466. The interest on the premium was around £415. 
So, the interest very nearly doubled the total cost of the policy. I think this was an unusual 
aspect of this policy and something Mr N is unlikely to have expected. And I have no reason 
to doubt that he would have considered this to be important information. I say this especially 
since he was buying a non-essential item of fairly modest cost. And also because the total 
cost of the PPI (nearly £900) amounted to a significant proportion (around 62%) of the base 
cost of Mr N’s television (around £1400).

Creation says it did bring the interest to Mr N’s attention. First, it says the credit agreement 
set out both the premium cost and the total cost (the premium plus the interest). Second, it 
says Mr N would have seen the policy summary I referred to above, which included a 
statement of price. The statement of price set out the premium cost and the interest payable 
on it separately.
I don’t agree with what Creation says, for the following reasons: 

The credit agreement, which Mr N signed, was the main finance document. Mr N could 
reasonably expect it to contain the important financial information he needed to know. 
But it didn’t. It didn’t show the PPI interest as a separate figure. Mr N would have had to 
deduct the PPI premium from the total cost to find out what the interest cost was. 

The PPI premium cost and the total amount payable for the policy were only two of 
many figures on the credit agreement. And those figures were only part of a large 
amount of overall information Mr N would have had to take in, in what is likely to have 
been a busy retail environment. I’m not persuaded Mr N would have known he would 
have to work out the PPI interest himself, based on the information in the credit 
agreement. And relying on him to do his own calculations in these circumstances 
couldn’t reasonably be said to be drawing this information to his attention in a clear way. 
 

The statement of price was on page two of a policy summary which was headed “Life, 
Accident, Sickness and Unemployment Payment Protection Insurance Policy 
Summary”. Nothing in its heading suggests it would contain important information about 
the cost of the policy. Nor does it make Mr N aware that he should look at the second 
page of the document to find out the interest being charged on his PPI premium. The 
information wasn’t in a prominent position. Yet this was the only document which 
showed the PPI interest as a separate figure. 
The policy summary also didn’t require Mr N to sign to show he had read or received it. 
So I can’t be sure he even saw this document, or that Creation brought it clearly to his 
attention at the time. Even if he did see it, I’m not persuaded Mr N would have realised 
that it contained important information about the cost of the policy over and above what 
he would reasonably have expected to find in the credit agreement itself. Given that he 
didn’t have to sign the policy summary, I also don’t find it likely that Mr N would have 
given it the same level of attention he might have given to the credit agreement – which 
he did have to sign. 

I also note that none of the documents showed the monthly cost of the policy. Creation 
tells us this was around £25 (compared to the monthly payments under the loan, with 
PPI included, of just under £100). Had they done so, this might have helped Mr N 
understand the cost of the PPI relative to what he was spending on the television he 
was buying. As a matter of good industry practice, this is information I might reasonably 
expect to see in relation to this type of policy. 

Finally, I also have concerns about the 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ period and the way 
this was explained in the credit agreement. During the deferred period Mr N would 
qualify for life cover under the policy. And if he repaid the finance before the end date he 
wouldn’t pay any interest on his loan, or anything for the PPI. But, if he didn’t repay 
during the deferred period, interest would be calculated from the date of the agreement. 
The whole balance outstanding (which included the PPI premium) would be accruing 
interest at 29.8% for the whole of the deferred period. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7279384
--------------------------

4
If Mr N didn’t repay within the deferred period (and he didn’t do so) he would have paid 
a substantial additional amount in interest on the single premium PPI policy in the first 
year, when the only benefit he got was the “free” life cover. I have taken into 
consideration that the credit agreement did set out how interest would be calculated. 
However, it was in a paragraph of small, closely-spaced text. It would not have been 
easy for Mr N to find. And, again, I’m not satisfied that this information was enough to 
make Mr N aware of the implications of how the deferred period would affect the interest 
payable on the PPI premium.  
Creation says the onus was on Mr N to review thoroughly the information he was given to 
ensure he had a full understanding before deciding to continue. That isn’t correct. It was 
Creation’s responsibility, clearly and fairly, to provide Mr N with enough information about 
the main features and benefits of the policy to enable him to make an informed choice. And, 
in this case, for the reasons I have given, I don’t think it did.
did the failing result in a difference to Mr N’s decision?
Establishing a clear (and significant) failing is not sufficient for me to uphold the complaint. 
I must also consider whether this failing would have made a difference to Mr N’s decision to 
purchase the policy. 
In this case and in his particular circumstances, I think it would have done. He took the 
PPI out alongside a purchase that was non-essential and of only moderate value. I do not 
think that, as Mr N went shopping for his television, obtaining payment protection for 
accident, sickness and unemployment in relation to the loan he was getting to pay for them 
is likely to have been at the forefront of his mind in the way it might have been if, say, the 
loan was much larger, or secured on his home. 
And his decision to buy the policy might well have been motivated at least in part by the 
initial period of free (assuming the loan was repaid within 12 months) life cover that was 
offered, and how that may have been presented to him.
And nor do I have reason to believe that the cost of the cover he was purchasing wouldn’t 
have been important to him, or that he would have considered that a policy whose cost was 
increased by around 89% as a result of being financed, and which added £25 to his monthly 
repayments (when they would have been only around £75 without the addition of PPI) – 
when neither of these things were made clear to him – represented fair value for him. 
Had Mr N been given clearer information, and knowing that he was making a relatively 
insignificant purchase on credit, I think Mr N is unlikely to have seen enough value in the 
policy to decide to buy it.
conclusion 
It follows that I do not think Creation met Mr N’s information needs, and that I think with 
better and clearer information about the cost of the policy Mr N is likely to have declined it; 
so I uphold his complaint.
fair compensation
I find that, if Mr N hadn’t bought the PPI policy, he would still have gone ahead with the loan. 
Therefore he should be put back in the position he would have been in if the PPI policy 
hadn’t been sold.

The loan and the PPI policy had a term of four years (including the deferred period) so 
should by now have run their course. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr N because PPI was added 
to the loan by:
  calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr N had taken out the 
loan without PPI;
  subtracting those amounts from what Mr N actually paid and paying him the 
difference; and 
  paying Mr N interest (simple, not compound) on each of these amounts at the rate 
of 8% a year from the date each payment was made to the date the redress is 
paid†.
B. Write to Mr N to set out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is required to deduct basic rate tax from this 
part of the compensation. Whether Mr N needs to take any further action will depend on his 
financial circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our 
website.
Mr N should refer back to Creation Consumer Finance Ltd if he is unsure of the approach it 
has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know 
more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Mr N redress calculated in accordance with the instructions set out above under 
“fair compensation”.

complaint
Mr T complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation), then known as Open and 
Direct Retail Services Limited, mis-sold a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy to him 
when he took out a loan.
background
In 2005 Mr T bought some furniture in a shop. He took out a loan to pay for it. At the same 
time he bought a single premium PPI policy, the cost of which was added to the loan. It gave 
him cover if he was off work because of accident and sickness, or he lost his job. And it 
included life cover too.
The loan had a 12 month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. This meant Mr T wouldn’t have to pay 
interest – or pay for the PPI - if he paid off the loan within that time. If he didn’t pay it off by 
then, he’d have to pay interest over the remaining 36 months of the loan, including on the 
premium for the PPI policy.
Mr T has raised various issues about how the PPI was sold to him. In particular, he 
complains that he wasn’t given any information about the policy. And he feels his financial 
position meant he didn’t need PPI. 
Our adjudicator thought Mr T’s complaint should be upheld. He didn’t think Creation had 
made it clear enough to Mr T how much the policy would cost. And he didn’t think Mr T 
would’ve taken out the policy, if Creation had done that.
But Creation disagrees. It says the paperwork Mr T was given was enough for him to 
understand what the PPI cost. So the complaint’s come to me for a decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments, to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website, and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Mr T’s case.
Having done that, I’ve decided to uphold Mr T’s complaint. I’ll explain why.
From what we’ve been told, I think the PPI was sold face to face, while Mr T was in the shop. 
Creation was responsible for telling Mr T about the cost and key features of the PPI, in a way 
that was clear and fair and wasn’t misleading. And I’ve looked particularly at the information 
he got about its cost. 
I don’t know what, if anything, was discussed about PPI in the store. But I’ve read the 
paperwork I’ve been given. It includes the credit agreement Mr T signed. That agreement 
told him the amount of the PPI premium. But it didn’t show the interest on that premium as a 
separate figure, or tell him the total cost of the PPI. I think it was reasonable for him to 
expect all the important information about the PPI’s cost to be made clear in the agreement 
– and it wasn’t.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7304723
--------------------------

2
And in my view the agreement didn’t make clear enough the effect the ‘buy now pay later’ 
period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay the loan off during the first 
12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest at a rate of 29.8%. This 
meant Mr T would pay a large amount of interest on the PPI cost in the first year, when the 
only benefit he’d got from it was ‘free’ life cover. 
I’ve seen a policy summary, which Creation says Mr T will’ve had. It includes a ‘statement of 
price’, on its second page. But I can’t be sure whether he was given this document, and if so 
when – or if he had time to read and think about it carefully, before he bought the PPI. 
If Mr T saw it, this document did tell him the amount of interest he’d have to pay on the PPI 
premium, if he didn’t pay off the loan inside 12 months. And it set out the total cost of the 
PPI. But this information was only towards the end of the policy summary. It wasn’t 
highlighted or easy to find, and wasn’t where Mr T might’ve reasonably expected it to be. So 
I don’t know whether it was drawn clearly to his attention - particularly as he was in a shop, 
and his main focus was probably on buying furniture, not on buying insurance. 
The interest payable on the PPI was almost as much as the premium itself. And the total 
cost of the policy was also high, compared to the modest sum Mr T was borrowing. This was 
unusual, and I think it would’ve been important information for Mr T to know, when he was 
deciding whether or not to buy the PPI. 
I see too that the paperwork he was given didn’t set out the monthly cost of the policy. This 
would’ve been good practice, and might’ve helped Mr T understand what the policy was 
going to cost him.
So in my view, Creation didn’t tell Mr T clearly enough how much the policy would cost, 
before he bought it. I don’t think Mr T would’ve properly understood the effect of the ‘buy 
now pay later’ period on the interest payable, and the total cost of the PPI. 
And based on what I know about his circumstances at that time, on balance I think it’s 
unlikely Mr T would’ve bought the policy, if he’d been made fully aware how much it was 
going to cost him. That’s particularly because Mr T has said he had substantial savings – 
much more than the amount of the loan – which he could’ve used to make the repayments, if 
he wasn’t working. Those monthly repayments – including the PPI - were only about £60. 
Creation says he could’ve cancelled the policy after signing the agreement. And that’s true. 
But in my view he should’ve been told the important information that he needed to know 
before he signed it. I don’t think the fact he didn’t cancel it afterwards meant he’d properly 
understood what it was costing him.
So overall, I think it’s fair and reasonable to uphold Mr T’s complaint. Mr T has lost out 
because of what Creation did wrong, and it needs to put things right.
putting things right
I’m told the loan and the PPI have now ended. But Mr T borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, 
so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he paid more than he should’ve each 
month. So Mr T needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So Creation should:
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7304723
--------------------------

3

Work out and pay Mr T the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr T paid each month, from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.
If Mr T made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr T a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’m upholding Mr T’s complaint. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is to pay him the fair compensation I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 July 2016.

complaint
Miss M complains about the quality of a table she acquired with finance from Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd (“CCF”).
background
Miss M says she bought a dining table and matching chairs in November 2017 and they 
were delivered the following month. She says she complained to the retailer in July 2018 
about splintering and scratching on the table top and that it was absorbent, so liquids left 
marks.
Miss M also says in response to her complaint the retailer said the table was made from 
completely untreated reclaimed timber and can mark easily. And that the product 
specification would’ve been discussed with her by the salesperson. But Miss M says this 
wasn’t mentioned by the salesperson or referred to in the care manual. And if it had been 
she would’ve taken steps to protect the table.
In addition, Miss M says the retailer has offered to supply a glass top for the table at a 
reduced cost. But she says if this had been mentioned when she was buying it, she would’ve 
bought a glass top then to prevent the table from getting damaged. And she says the table’s 
already damaged so there’s no point in putting a see through glass top on it now.
So, Miss M says her ideal outcome would be for the table to be replaced with a new one and 
she would put a glass top on it.   
Our investigator thought Miss M’s complaint shouldn’t be upheld. 
Miss M disagreed with the investigator’s conclusions. She gave us information from the 
retailer’s website which she said clearly describes the table as ‘reclaimed timber’ but she 
said it doesn’t state anywhere in the product description that it’s ‘untreated’. She said her 
invoice doesn’t even state it’s untreated. And she said the table’s clearly been mis-sold.        
So, the matter’s been referred to me to make a final decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I’ve decided not to uphold Miss M’s complaint and I’ll explain why.
CCF provided the finance Miss M used to buy her dining table. So, this means she has an 
equal right to seek redress from it for any breach of contract or misrepresentation as she has 
from the retailer. 
I see when Miss M complained to the retailer about this matter it arranged an independent 
inspection that found the table had ‘loads of marks and a big scratch’ but the inspector 
concluded this was ‘in-house’ damage and that there was no fault with the table, which was 
later confirmed as matching the in-store display model.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7305660
--------------------------

2
So, in light of the contents of the independent inspection report, I can’t conclude the table 
was of unsatisfactory quality when it was supplied to Miss M.
I note Miss M hasn’t suggested she was wrongly told the table was treated or finished, rather 
that she wasn’t told it was untreated. I’ve seen sales information for the range of furniture in 
question that says ‘The timber is untreated with no protection, so table mats, coasters, along 
with a tablecloth need to be used’. I don’t know whether Miss M saw this information before 
she bought the table and I don’t know what discussions took place between her and the 
salesperson. But from everything I’ve seen I don’t have enough information to conclude it’s 
most likely the table was misrepresented to her during the sales process.    
So, for these reasons, I can’t fairly and reasonably uphold Miss M’s complaint.   
my final decision
I don’t uphold Miss M’s complaint against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 August 2019.

complaint
Mr R complains that a TV he bought with finance from Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
(Creation) is not of satisfactory quality.
background
Mr R ordered a TV and it was delivered on 30 September 2014. Mr R had paid for it to be 
installed but this could not be completed and Mr R said he would install the TV himself. 
When Mr R set up the TV he noticed that there was a fault on the screen and he reported 
this to the retailer. The retailer offered a repair or a reconditioned TV because Mr R was 
outside its 30 day replacement or return period. Mr R was unhappy with this and complained 
to Creation. Creation said that there was nothing it could do because Mr R was outside the 
30 day period. Mr R has bought a new TV and wants a refund for the broken TV.
Our adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that the TV 
was faulty when it was supplied to Mr R and it was reasonable for him to request a 
replacement. Because of the time that Creation took to deal with the complaint Mr R has 
bought a new TV and so the adjudicator thought it was fair that Mr R had a full refund. 
Creation did not agree and replied to say in summary that a repair was a reasonable option 
and Mr R hadn’t co-operated with requests for evidence about the damage.
  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I have reached the same 
conclusions as the adjudicator for broadly similar reasons.
I think that the TV was faulty when it was supplied to Mr R. He complained about the fault as 
soon as the TV was installed. Mr R has been clear from the beginning that he did not want a 
refurbished replacement and I think that this is reasonable in the circumstances. He paid for 
a new TV and he had not used it so I think that it was reasonable for him to want a new TV 
to replace the faulty one. Mr R agreed that an engineer could visit to inspect the damage and 
try to repair it. But he did not want to have the TV collected and returned after a repair 
because he would need to take time off work. 
I think that because Mr R had not used the TV and it was faulty from the beginning it was 
reasonable for him to expect a new replacement. Mr R had paid for a new TV and he could 
reasonably expect it to be free from faults. It is unfortunate that the fault wasn’t discovered 
sooner and within the 30 day period but Mr R reported the fault as soon as he installed the 
TV and this was only a short time outside the 30 days.
After Mr R couldn’t resolve the problem with the retailer he asked Creation to look into his 
complaint. Because of the length of time that this process has taken Mr R has bought a new 
TV. I think that had Creation looked at Mr R’s complaint sooner, a repair could have been 
arranged at minimal inconvenience to Mr R and the TV could have been collected at a time 
when Mr R wasn’t working. Because of the time that has passed I don’t think a repair is 
reasonable now. Mr R has bought a new TV which I think is understandable and reasonable 
in the circumstances.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7333108
--------------------------

I agree with the adjudicator that Creation should pay Mr R £100 to compensate him for the 
poor service in dealing with his complaint. It should also arrange for the TV to be returned 
and the finance agreement cancelled at no cost to Mr R. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of it Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd should:
1.
Pay Mr R £100 for the poor service.
2.
Arrange to collect the TV at no cost to Mr R and cancel the finance agreement.
3.
Refund all payments made by Mr R under the agreement.
4.
Pay interest on all payments made at 8% simple per year from the date the payment 
was made until Mr R gets it back. If Creation considers that tax should be deducted 
from the interest element of my award it should provide Mr R with a tax deduction 
certificate so he can reclaim the tax if he is eligible to do so. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2015.

complaint
This complaint is about a loan payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy taken out in 2010. 
Mr and Mrs B say Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold them the PPI. The credit was 
solely in Mr B’s name and the PPI covered Mr B. Mr and Mrs B jointly brought this complaint, 
but I’ll only refer to Mr B in my decision.  
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Mr B’s case.
I’ve decided the policy wasn’t mis-sold because:

I think Creation made it clear that Mr B didn’t have to take out the PPI and they chose 
to take it out – although I can understand why he may not remember this.
I haven’t seen any of the paperwork completed when Mr B applied for the loan. But I 
have seen a separate ‘Payment Plus Acceptance Form’ (PPI) sent to Mr B by post 
following his application for credit.
This form briefly outlines the cost of PPI per month. It also states ‘The purchase of 
Creation Consumer Finance Payment Plus Insurance is not a requirement of your 
finance agreement.’ 
Mr B has then signed separately below a statement that reads; ‘I wish to take out 
Payment Plus to cover my existing Consumer Finance borrowing.’ Mr B has also 
completed and signed a separate direct debit mandate for the PPI.
I’ve considered what Mr B has said about going to collect his car and noticing that the 
cost per month had increased. Mr B has said it was at this point that he was told 
insurance had been added but it wasn’t until a later date that he noticed it was PPI. 
Creation has said that shortly after the sale, the insurers would have sent more 
information about the PPI, including the full terms and conditions. 
So, I think Mr B would reasonably have been aware that he had PPI at that point or 
at the very least questioned it with Creation – much sooner than he did. But the 
evidence is that PPI remained on the account for some time.
Although Mr B has said he doesn’t recall signing for PPI, the evidence I’ve seen 
doesn’t support what Mr B has said. It’s a possibility, given the time that’s passed, 
that Mr B may not recall everything that happened clearly. The form I’ve seen 
presented PPI as optional and Mr B signed to give his consent to taking it out.
I’ve also noted that there are inconsistencies in Mr B’s testimony. For example, in his 
PPI questionnaire he’s said that PPI was automatically added and when he 
questioned it, he was told that the loan would not be agreed without taking PPI. But 
this contradicts what he’s then said about not knowing that he had PPI until a later 
date. In any case, the separate form he completed to take PPI states, ‘The purchase

of Creation Consumer Finance Payment Plus Insurance is not a requirement of your 
finance agreement.’ 

Creation didn’t recommend the PPI to Mr B so it didn’t have to check if it was right for 
him. But it did have to make sure Mr B got the information he needed to decide if it 
was right for him.

It’s possible the information Creation gave Mr B about the PPI wasn’t as clear as it 
should’ve been. But he chose to take out the PPI - so it looks like he wanted this type 
of cover. 
Based on what I’ve seen of his circumstances at the time it doesn’t look like he was 
affected by any of the exclusions to or limits on the PPI cover - so it would have been 
useful for him if something went wrong. It also looks like the PPI was affordable. So I 
don’t think better information about the PPI would have put him off taking out the 
cover. 

Which means Creation doesn’t have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr B.
But Creation will pay back some of the cost of the PPI to Mr B because: 

When the policy was sold, Creation expected to get a high level of commission and 
profit share (more than 50% of the PPI premium) - so it should have told Mr B about 
that. Because Creation didn’t tell Mr B, that was unfair. 

To put that right, Creation has basically offered to pay back the amount of 
commission and profit share that was above 50% of the PPI premium - and I think 
that offer is fair in this case.
I’ve thought about everything Mr B has said, but these points don’t change my decision.
what the business needs to do
Creation has to pay back to Mr B any commission and profit share it got that was more than 
50% of the PPI premium. Creation should also pay back to Mr B any extra interest he paid 
because of that.
Creation should pay back to Mr B the extra he paid each month because the commission 
and profit share it got was more than 50% of the cost of PPI. Creation should also pay Mr B 
8%* simple interest on each payment.
*Businesses have to take basic rate tax off this interest. Mr B can claim back the tax if he doesn’t pay tax.
my final decision
The PPI policy wasn’t mis-sold – so Creation Consumer Finance Ltd does not have to pay 
back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr B.
But Creation Consumer Finance Ltd does have to pay back to Mr B any commission and 
profit share it got that was more than 50% of the PPI premium.

complaint
The estate of the late Mr W complains about the response of Creation Consumer Finance 
Ltd to a claim under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in relation to a fixed term loan Mr W took 
out to finance solar panels.
The loan provided by Creation was to finance the purchase of solar panels. The estate 
alleges the benefits of the solar panels were mispresented by the third party that also acted 
as the credit intermediary for the Creation loan. And that these misrepresentations caused 
Mr W to enter a finance agreement he otherwise would not have. 
background 
Sadly, after having brought his complaint to this service, Mr W has passed away. His estate 
has maintained the complaint and is represented by a third party. Many of the submissions 
made have been put forward by either the estate or the representatives. But, for the sake of 
simplicity, I will largely just refer to them as Mr W’s comments.
In 2014, Mr W entered an agreement with a third party, “IP”, for the installation of solar 
panels on his property. As part of the arrangements, Mr W entered a fixed term loan with 
Creation to pay for these panels and their installation. IP acted as the credit intermediary for 
the loan. The total amount, including interest and charges, repayable over the 10-year term 
of the loan was around £16,650.
Mr W said he was told the solar panels would produce energy, which would not only reduce 
the amount he needed to buy from his energy supplier, but that the energy supplier would 
also pay for the energy he produced. Mr W said IP told him this would mean the solar panels 
would be “self-funding”.
However, Mr W said that the solar panels did not result in the level of savings required to 
offset the monthly cost of the loan. And he considered IP to have misrepresented the 
arrangements. Mr W said he would not have taken the loan had he been given correct 
information.
Mr W contacted Creation to raise his concerns and claimed under the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 (“the Act”). He said that, as a result of section 75 of the Act, Creation was responsible 
for the actions of IP when it sold the loan. And he wanted Creation to cancel the loan, 
refunding all payments made. Creation did not uphold the claim and provided Mr W with a 
complaint final response letter. Mr W referred the complaint to this service.
Since then, Creation has accepted that IP may have made misrepresentations and said it 
was willing to uphold the claim. Creation offered to put Mr W in the position he would be in if 
the savings from the solar panels over the term of the loan equalled the repayments Mr W 
had to make under the loan.
Our investigator thought a fair outcome would be putting Mr W in a position where the panels 
were self-funding over the original term of the loan, which is what Creation’s offer did. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7372502
--------------------------

Mr W was still unwilling to accept this as a resolution to his complaint. Mr W said he had 
been led to believe the payments he would be given by the energy supplier for producing 
energy alone would cover the cost of the panels. And that he would also benefit from the 
savings achieved by not buying as much energy, something the offer did not take into 
account. Mr W also said that there was a potential ongoing cost of maintaining the solar 
panels, which had not been covered by Creation’s offer. 
On learning of Mr W’s passing, Creation revised its offer, and agreed to write off the 
outstanding balance of the loan as of March 2019. Our investigator felt this was fair, and 
went further than the original offer. However, Mr W’s estate was still unwilling to accept this 
offer. They advised that the finance agreement should be fully rescinded and all payments 
should be refunded with 8% interest. However, no further evidence to support this position 
was provided.
As such, this complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In this case, the complaint that this service is able to consider is whether Creation has 
appropriately dealt with Mr W’s claim under the Act. Whilst the mechanisms of the Act mean 
that Creation can be held liable for certain actions of IP, it should be borne in mind that it 
was not Creation that made any of the representations to Mr W at the time of the sale.
Where the facts of a case are in dispute, I must determine on the balance of probabilities 
what happened. In this case, the majority of the facts are no longer in dispute. Creation has 
accepted that IP may have made misrepresentations when Mr W entered the arrangements, 
including the loan. 
As such, my decision is focussed on determining what a fair and reasonable level of 
compensation for this is. In cases like this one, determining fair compensation isn’t an exact 
science. There are a range of options that might be considered fair and reasonable.
The role of this service is to resolve disputes fairly and reasonably with minimum formality. 
Generally speaking, where a financial business is found to have not acted appropriately, we 
will try to put the complainant in the position they would have been in had the business acted 
appropriately.
So, in this case, I consider my role is to determine whether the offer Creation has made is an 
appropriate response to Mr W’s claim under the Act, taking into account the particular 
circumstances of this case.
It seems likely that, had IP not have made the misrepresentations is apparently did, Mr W 
would not have entered into the arrangements. He would not have had the solar panels fitted 
and would not have entered into the loan with Creation. 
We do often try to put complainants back in the position they would have been in, had the 
inappropriate event not occurred. So, there is some argument for completely unwinding the 
loan agreement, and for Mr W’s estate to be refunded the payments made.

However, this would also necessitate the removal of the solar panels from the property. And 
the benefits achieved by having the solar panels – both the payments made by Mr W’s 
energy supplier and the reduction in his energy bills – would have to be deducted from any 
refund made. 
This would not only significantly reduce any refund payable to Mr W’s estate, but the 
removal of the panels would also cause a high degree of inconvenience to the estate. 
Given the basis of this complaint does not relate to the solar panels themselves, but rather to 
the finances surrounding them, I consider that a reasonable resolution should just address 
the financial side. And that removal of the panels is not practical in the circumstances. 
Whilst I note there may be a future cost of maintaining them, I need to bear in mind that the 
panels do provide financial benefits to the estate. 
Mr W estimated that the payment received from his energy supplier, for the energy the 
panels generated, is around £700 a year. There may be some reduction to the amount of 
energy produced each year (though energy costs themselves may also change), but the 
energy supplier is likely to pay a sum close to this for the approximate 20 year lifespan of the 
panels. That would give a total of £14,000. This would not take into account the financial 
benefit of any reduction in the energy that would need to be bought from the supplier.
By writing off the balance of the loan as of March 2019, the solar panels have effectively cost 
around £8,000. Mr W has estimated the future cost of maintaining the panels at around 
£800. 
These numbers are only estimates. But it seems clear that Creation’s offer means having the 
solar panels will be financial advantageous to Mr W’s estate. So, I don’t think it would be fair 
to expect Creation to go further and fully unwind the finance agreement.
I consider that a fair and reasonable resolution to this complaint is for Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd to write off any outstanding debt on this loan, as of 20 March 2019.
my final decision
My final decision is that this complaint should be upheld. If it has not already done so, 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should write off any outstanding debt on the late Mr W’s 
loan, as of 20 March 2019.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask the estate of the 
late Mr W to accept or reject my decision before 27 August 2020.

complaint
Mr C complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy to him.
background
In 2006, Mr C bought some goods in a shop and he took out a £1,248 (excluding interest) 
loan to pay for it. At the same time, Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £509.25 
(excluding interest), which was added to the loan and attracted interest. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr C wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise, he’d pay interest (including £625.98 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr C’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And she didn’t think Mr C would’ve bought the policy if it 
had done so.
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr C was given would 
have given him enough information about the cost of the policy.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Mr C’s case.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr C’s complaint because Creation didn’t properly tell Mr C how much 
the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the credit 
agreement didn’t show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to 
expect Mr C to work out the interest himself. He was entitled to expect all the 
important information about the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. So it wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr C would expect it to be. And I can’t 
be sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his 
attention was on buying a Hi-Fi system – not on insurance.

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been 
good practice and might have helped Mr C to understand what the policy was costing 
him.

The information on the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr C aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t 
pay the loan off during the first 12 months, the whole amount, including the PPI, 
attracted interest at 32.4%. This meant Mr C would pay a substantial extra amount of 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7396862
--------------------------

2
interest on the PPI cost in the first year, when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ 
life cover.

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr C was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr C would’ve seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as he was borrowing a small amount over a fairly short term.

I don’t think Mr C would have bought the policy if he’d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I’ve decided to uphold Mr C’s complaint.
what Creation should do to put things right
Mr C borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he 
paid more than he should’ve each month. So Mr C needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So, Creation should:

Work out and pay Mr C the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr C paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year from 
then on†.
If Mr C made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained I’ve decided to uphold Mr C’s complaint and direct Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd to pay him compensation as set out in this decision. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 January 2016.

complaint
Mr P complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd charged him interest on an interest free 
loan because his payment was late.
background
On 30 September 2017 Mr P ordered a sofa with a loan provided by Creation. It was 
delivered on 12 December. The terms of the loan allowed for Mr P to pay it in full within a 
specified period and so avoid paying any interest. Mr P says he was told the 12 month 
period began when the sofa was delivered. 
On 2 July 2018 Creation sent Mr P a letter to say he needed to pay off his loan by 31 July 
2018 to avoid paying interest. Mr P wrote to Creation on 11 July to ask why the payment was 
required by 31 July. It responded on 16 July 2018 informing him that it would investigate the 
special offer date and write to Mr P when this had been completed. I gather it next got in 
touch with him in October. In the meantime Mr P paid the outstanding balance of £908 on 30 
August. Creation sought to charge him interest and Mr P complained.
Creation rejected his complaint and so he brought it to this service. It was considered by one 
of our investigators who recommend it be upheld. He said Creation was correct that the offer 
ended on 30 July 2018. However, he didn’t think Creation had responded promptly to Mr P’s 
query and he believed Mr P had grounds to believe that Creation would get back in touch 
with him before he had to repay £908 to qualify for the special offer. 
He said that he thought Mr P would have paid the £908 to ensure he met the terms of the 
special offer. As Creation created an expectation that it would let Mr P know when it had 
established the correct special offer date, the investigator didn’t think it had acted fairly in 
asking Mr P to repay the total of £1,619.64.
Creation didn’t agree and said that the documentation Mr P had signed showed the payment 
date of 31 July 2018 and this had been confirmed by the reminding letter. It hadn’t told him it 
would be extending the date when it responded to him on 16 July and so he should have 
paid it on time if he wished to avoid paying interest. As there were no extenuating 
circumstances it didn’t believe it had done anything wrong.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I am satisfied that Mr P genuinely believed that he didn’t need to pay until 12 months after 
delivery. I accept the documentation given to him at the time of purchase states otherwise, 
but it is clear he had it in his mind that he had 12 months to pay and that didn’t begin running 
until delivery. 
If he had ignored the reminding letter in July 2018 I would have difficulty in upholding his 
complaint. But he wrote to Creation and queried the date. It now says the matter is clear that 
he had signed an agreement to pay by 31 July, but it chose not to tell him that when it wrote 
to him on 16 July. It is not clear why Creation needed to take much longer to address what it 
suggests is a straightforward matter.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7409970
--------------------------

2
I am satisfied that Mr P was willing to pay at the appropriate time to avoid paying interest 
and he simply wanted clarification form Creation. This wasn’t forthcoming until after 31 July. 
Nor did the 16 July letter tell him to pay by 31 July to protect his position. Therefore, I believe 
his complaint should be upheld and he should not be charged interest.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to treat the loan as being repaid by 31 July and refund any interest and charges imposed 
incorrectly on Mr P. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to 
ask Mr P to accept or reject my decision before 24 May 2019.

complaint
Mr B says Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy to him. 
background
In 2008 Mr B took out a loan with Creation over the phone, to refinance some existing credit 
cards and a loan. At the same time Creation sold him a PPI policy. It would make his loan 
payments for up to 12 months if he couldn’t get work, or was too sick to work. And it would 
pay off the loan if he died. 
Mr B borrowed extra to pay for the policy, which would be repaid over the loan term with 
interest. However, he took out another loan with Creation a few months later and paid off the 
first loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr B’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had done enough during 
the phone call, or in the paperwork it sent him, to make Mr B properly aware of how much 
the policy cost. And she didn’t think Mr B would have taken the policy out if he’d known this. 
Creation disagreed. It said the cost of the policy was clearly set out in the paperwork and it 
was up to Mr B to read what it sent to him.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr B’s complaint.
Creation sold the policy to Mr B over the phone. It hasn’t got a call recording. But it’s 
provided a call script it says would have been followed. Mr B has strongly disagreed that the 
script was followed. He’s provided a detailed account of several conversations he says he 
had with the same, named, Creation staff member. 
Mr B says he took PPI with the first loan because the staff member told him to ‘off the 
record’. He says she told him that, being self-employed, he would have a better chance of 
having the loan approved if he took PPI with it. But he also says the same staff member told 
him not to take PPI when she offered him a ‘bump up’ loan a few months later; because he 
would go over Creation’s maximum lending limit and the loan wouldn’t be approved. 
Mr B has been very detailed and also very consistent in what he’s said. Based on the 
content of the script and on Mr B’s recollections, I’m concerned he might not have properly 
understood that he had a real choice about whether to buy the policy. But even if I leave that 
to one side, I also share the adjudicator’s concerns about how the policy was explained to 
Mr B; particularly the cost of it.
The policy cost over £4,000, with a further £2,500 in interest. The script doesn’t suggest that 
Mr B would have been given either the single premium cost or the interest figure over the 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7419633
--------------------------

2
phone. And the interest also wasn’t shown separately in the loan agreement he received 
afterwards. 
Creation says the interest was given separately in the ‘statement of price’, which was 
included in the policy summary it says it would have sent to Mr B. But I can’t be sure Mr B 
got that document. He is certain he didn’t. And he’s provided the covering letter he got with 
his agreement in the post, which doesn’t refer to the summary or direct him to read any 
enclosed information about the policy.
So it’s possible Mr B didn’t see the policy summary. Even if he did see it, the interest was on 
page three. That wasn’t a prominent location, or where Mr B would reasonably expect to find 
it. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the policy to be in 
the loan agreement. 
The policy provided cover for 60 months, when the loan was for 84 months. And the way the 
cancellation terms worked meant Mr B wouldn’t get the level of refund he might have 
expected to get from the cost of the policy if he cancelled it early. This wasn’t properly 
explained in the call script. Whilst it was in the policy summary, it wasn’t prominent. And I 
return to the fact that Mr B says he never received the summary. His description of the 
conversations he had also suggests he wasn’t told about this when he was arranging the 
second ‘bump up’ loan. 
It was Creation’s responsibility to give Mr B enough information about the main features and 
benefits of the policy so that he could decide whether it was right for him. Creation should 
have ensured his attention was drawn to the important information about the policy which 
would be likely to affect his decision making. I’m not satisfied that Creation met its 
responsibility to give Mr B enough information to make an informed choice. 
As Mr B was using the first loan to refinance existing debt I think the cost of the policy would 
have been important to him. And the interest charged on the policy greatly increased the 
cost of it. The inflexible cancellation terms also meant it would cost him more if he wanted to 
pay the loan off early or refinance it. 
In his circumstances, I don’t think Mr B would have bought the policy if not for Creation’s 
failings. So it follows that I uphold his complaint.
what Creation should do to put things right
Mr B borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his first loan was bigger than it should’ve been. 
And his second loan was also bigger than it should’ve been because it cost him more to 
repay the first loan. He also paid more than he should’ve each month on both loans. 
So Mr B needs to get back the extra he’s paid and start paying what he should’ve been 
paying all along.
So, Creation should:

change the amount Mr B has left to pay on the second loan so his payments are the 
same now as they would be if he hadn’t taken out PPI on his first loan

work out and pay the difference between what Mr B paid each month on his first and 
second loans and what he would’ve paid without PPI
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7419633
--------------------------

3

add simple interest to the extra amounts Mr B paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back (the rate of interest is 8% a year†)

show Mr B how it worked this out and the amount he still owes

show Mr B how much his future payments will be.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr B’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay Mr B the compensation 
I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 February 2015.

complaint
Miss L complains Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (CCF) declined her application for
Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) and hasn’t given her a reasonable explanation for its decision.
background
Miss L applied to CCF, in store to buy a fridge, for a BNPL agreement. Her application was 
declined.
When Miss L asked for information to help her understand why CCF had taken that decision 
she wasn’t satisfied with CCF’s response as it didn’t give her a specific reason.
Miss L referred her complaint to us. Our investigator said CCF was entitled to keep 
commercially sensitive information about its lending criteria private. But that Miss L’s 
application had been declined on information that wasn’t correct. He said Miss L should have 
been told this, as the declined application had caused her some considerable upset, and she 
was now worried about any future applications she might make. He said CCF should pay 
£150 for the trouble and upset Miss L had experienced.
CCF didn’t agree as it said it had followed its processes correctly and had given Miss L 
sufficient information about why her application had been declined. CCF has asked for an 
ombudsman to decide.
Miss L reiterated her complaint that she hadn’t been given a reason for her application being 
declined. And she wanted the search removed from her credit file.
I issued a provisional decision in September 2019 which said:
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise how frustrating this situation must be for Miss L and I understand why she wants a 
better understanding of CCF’s lending decision – she has a good credit score and receives a 
regular income. I know this will be disappointing for Miss L but my current thinking is that I’m 
not upholding this complaint and I’ll explain why.
It isn’t the role of our service to insist that credit should be provided when an application is 
made. As ultimately the decision to bear the risk of the lending has to sit with the lender. And 
a business must undertake a reasonable assessment of the credit worthiness of a customer 
before entering into a regulated credit agreement, as was the case here with Miss L’s BNPL 
application.
Banks and other financial institutions have a legitimate interest in making sure they’re able to 
properly identify who’s applying to them for credit. And they have developed systems to try 
to identify fraudulent activity. But those systems sometimes also identify legitimate 
applications as potentially fraudulent.
Miss L’s application for credit was legitimate and it will have been embarrassing and 
frustrating for her to have had her application for credit declined. But it’s a commercial 
decision for a lender as to whether or not it lends money to a customer – and there’s no 
requirement for it to explain the specific reason for its decision to the customer.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7422751
--------------------------

2
But it should give the applicant an indication as to the reason why.
When Miss L asked CCF the reason why her application was declined it said its “final score 
was below our acceptance level”. But this didn’t set Miss L’s mind at rest as she was baffled 
as to why this would be given her credit history.
But CCF’s did go on to say:
“There are many reasons why applications are declined such as; no/different 
information on the voters roll, adverse bureau information on credit files, employment 
status, low income etc.”
Although CCF didn’t give a specific reason it did try to explain the reasons behind her 
decline. And CCF wouldn’t have told Miss L the exact reason for the decline. As, potentially 
if the reason was known, changes could be made by an applicant. This is for safeguarding 
purposes, as outlined above as not all applications are legitimate.
I can understand why Miss L has been left feeling so frustrated by the process. Our 
investigator when dealing with CCF did find out that the information entered on Miss L’s 
application wasn’t correct. And so when CCF did its credit worthiness check the information 
input didn’t correlate, so its system generated an automated decline.
CCF has said its process is for the retailer to double check the information is correct with the 
applicant. I can’t know what happened on that day so I can’t hold CCF responsible for 
making its assessment on the information that was entered. But the decline was most likely 
the result of the retailer recording Miss L’s details incorrectly.
Miss L wanted a more detailed explanation as she posed little risk and believes she should 
have received the credit. But as I’ve said above, it’s the business in these situations that 
bears the risk. And the decision should sit with them to make this. I haven’t seen anything 
which has indicated that CCF hasn’t done this fairly or not in line with its process.
CCF has also agreed to remove the record of the search made when Miss L applied for the 
credit from her credit file. So I won’t be asking it do anything more in this case.
I hope by now knowing what went wrong on the day will give Miss L some piece of mind 
should she make any further applications for credit. But as I don’t think CCF acted unfairly I 
don’t think it is fair or reasonable for me to ask CCF to pay any compensation to Miss L.
responses to my provisional decision
CCF agreed with the provisional decision and confirmed it had requested the amendment to 
be made to Miss L’s credit file.
Miss L didn’t agree with the provisional decision and said 

it wasn’t acceptable for a person with an exemplary credit record to be turned down 
for credit without being told the reason why – especially when it was a clerical error;

CCF should accept when its made a mistake and right that mistake by explaining 
why the credit was refused; and


didn’t accept that CCF had given her an indication of why she had been refused 
credit.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I’m not persuaded to 
change my decision, I’ll explain why.
I can understand why Miss L is frustrated by what has happened. Its clear Miss L’s date of 
birth was input incorrectly. And the relevant guidance does say that CCF will be responsible 
for the acts and omissions of its appointed representatives. 
But as I outlined in my provisional decision CCF’s process is for any information to be double 
checked with the applicant at the time. I can’t know for sure what happened on the day, and I 
can’t know if CCF’s process was followed by its representative or not. So, I don’t think it was 
unfair for CCF to base its decision on the belief its process had been followed and that the 
information had been correctly given and confirmed by Miss L.
I know Miss L feels she should have had a fuller explanation as to why she’d been refused. 
And I think this explanation would have prevented the need for Miss L to bring a complaint. 
But it’s a commercial decision for a lender as to whether or not it lends money to a customer 
– and there’s no requirement for it to explain the specific reason for its decision to the 
customer. But it should give the applicant an indication as to the reason why.
Miss L doesn’t think CCF has given this indication, but as I said in my provisional decision 
CCF explained her score was below its acceptance level, and went on to explain some 
reasons why this would be. So I think this does give Miss L an indication of its reasons.
my final decision
For the reasons outlined above I don’t uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2019.

complaint
Mrs F is unhappy with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd’s rejection of her claim against it 
under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
background
I issued a provisional decision in January 2018 concluding that Mrs F’s complaint should be 
upheld. I also set out what Creation should do to put things right. I attach a redacted version 
of my provisional decision which forms part of this final decision. 
Creation responded to say that it does not agree with my provisional decision. It said, in 
summary: 

It remains of the view that undue weight has been given to what Mrs F and her 
representative has said. 

Mrs F did not raise any concern with Creation for over two years.

In the absence of explanation or evidence regarding its origins, the telephone sales 
script referred to in the provisional decision is totally unreliable and should be 
disregarded.

It would invite me to consider two additional documents, namely the i-Power Code of 
Conduct and Charter document and the i-Power training manual. 

Whilst it “understands the persuasive nature of the RECC (Renewable Energy Consumer 
Code) report”, there is no suggestion that Mrs F’s case was considered at the RECC 
panel hearings. The outcome of the panel hearings doesn’t mean that every customer 
who purchased the system from i-Power was a victim of mis-selling.
However, Creation offered to settle the complaint by proposing an alternative remedy to the 
one I had suggested in my provisional decision. It asked me to consider that offer.  
The alternative proposal was put to Mrs F. She said that she is unwilling to accept the 
alternative proposal and would like to accept the remedy suggested in my provisional 
decision. Mrs F and her representative said, in summary:

Though Mrs F was initially willing to accept the settlement proposed by the investigator, 
on reflection, she is concerned about ongoing upkeep and maintenance of the system. It 
could cost her about £2,000 to £4,000, particularly as the inverter may need replacing on 
more than one occasion during the expected life of the solar panels. 

It is evident from the RECC panel determinations that there were systemic problems with 
i-Power even before Mrs F signed up for the solar panels. So Creation knew that the 
business it was accepting from i-Power was “toxic” and it was put on clear notice this 
was the case when these RECC panel decisions were published and put into the public 
domain. Creation had an obligation to monitor the business that it was accepting from i-
Power. If it failed to do this or carried it out in an ineffective manner then it must accept 
responsibility for the consequences.

The telephone script and sales presentation were provided by an ex i-Power sales 
representative. 
Creation responded further to state:
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028
--------------------------


There is nothing to suggest that Mrs F would need to replace the inverter at any point 
and, even if it was required, the cost of replacement should only be around £1,000. The 
ongoing maintenance costs to her should be negligible. 

Mrs F’s credit agreement is dated April 2014 and the earliest RECC report is dated June 
2014. Creation initiated the termination of its relationship with i-Power in September 
2014, completing the process in December 2014. This clearly demonstrates that it took 
decisive action once concerns about i-Power were brought to its attention. However 
these concerns do not demonstrate that mis-selling took place in every case where i-
Power was involved. Notwithstanding this, Creation has now made an offer which it 
believes is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.
I considered the submissions made by both parties. I remained of the view that Mrs F’s 
complaint should succeed. However, I considered that the revised proposal set out by 
Creation is fair, subject to some modifications. Accordingly I wrote to both parties recently. I 
said, in summary:

The training manual provided to me by Creation also refers to “Self funding” as one of 
the benefits of solar panels. To me, this in fact adds to the weight of information / 
evidence already available which suggest that it was more likely than not that the 
salesperson led Mrs F to believe the solar panels would be self funding and come at no 
extra cost to her. 

The fact that Creation took action to terminate its relationship with i-Power following the 
RECC report suggests to me that Creation itself had some concerns about the way i-
Power sold the panels.

Unless the meeting between Mrs F and i-Power salesperson was recorded (and it was 
not), it would not be possible for me to know exactly what was discussed. So, I do have 
to look at all the other available evidence and information to decide what is more likely to 
have happened in this instance. Having done so, I do think that the cumulative weight of 
evidence and information presented to me is such that it is more likely that the i-Power 
salesperson misrepresented the benefits to Mrs F.

I also remain of the view, for the reasons already explained, that Mrs F was entitled to 
rely on what she was told by the salesperson in deciding whether or not she should enter 
into the purchase and the credit agreements.

Creation has questioned why Mrs F did not raise any concern with it for over two years 
since installation of the solar panels. Mrs F says that it took her some time to realise that 
the solar panels weren’t delivering the financial benefits and as soon as she realised it, 
she made her claim. 
Firstly it should be borne in mind that Mrs F has made her claim under s.75 well within 
six years of the sale. She also brought her complaint to us within the time limits permitted 
under our Dispute Resolution rules. So the fact that she brought up the issue with 
Creation or complained to us more than two years after the installation does not prevent 
her from making her claim or complaint. 
Also, it is not that straightforward to work out the exact benefits one could derive from the 
installation of solar panels. There are FiT payments to contend with and they are paid 
usually on a quarterly basis. Then there are savings from the use of the electricity 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028
--------------------------

3
generated, but the savings that could be directly attributable to the solar panels are not 
easily evident from the energy bills. As I mentioned in my provisional decision, there are 
various other factors that affect the energy costs and so it is not easy to work out the 
savings that could solely be attributable to the solar panels. 
Indeed I see from the expert’s report provided by Creation, the author says on the first 
page: “Comparison of electricity bills before and after the installation of PV (and to a 
lesser extent FiT statements) is an extremely unreliable method of valuing the benefit of 
self-generation for a number of technical, behavioural and logistical reasons..”
So I have some sympathy with Mrs F’s position here. Having carefully considered the 
arguments from both sides and given the complexities involved in working out the true 
cost and benefit of the solar panels, I accept her explanation as what is most likely to 
have happened. I agree that there would come a point when a consumer ought to realise 
that the solar panels were clearly not giving them the benefits which they were led to 
expect. But I think in this instance, given the complexities, the time Mrs F took to do so is 
understandable.

I remain of the view that Mrs F has suffered a loss as a result of the misrepresentation 
by i-Power and as Creation has equal liability for the misrepresentation made by i 
Power, it is responsible for Mrs F’s loss. 

Arriving at fair compensation is not an exact science, particularly in instances like this 
where some predictions are needed. My aim is to put Mrs F as close to the position she 
would have been in but for the misrepresentation, taking into account her objectives at 
the time. And at the same time arrive at a remedy that is fair to both parties. 

I think that Mrs F’s complaint is not so much about solar panels themselves but that they 
were misrepresented to be self-funding. So by removing the effect of misrepresentation, 
this would put right the financial impact to Mrs F over the term of the loan. I think a fair 
and simple approach would have been to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the potential 
savings (and income) to Mrs F from the panels over the 10 year term of the loan and 
simply rework the loan such that she pays no more than that amount over that term; and 
she keeps the solar panel system.

I consider that Creation’s revised proposal more or less achieves this objective but for 
some adjustments. Firstly it should take into account actual figures to date in terms of 
electricity generation and FiT payments. The electricity tariff it used in the calculation 
should reflect Mrs F’s actual tariff. And it should also make an allowance for possible 
future deterioration.
Mrs F’s representative responded to say that as I have found that there has been a 
misrepresentation, Mrs F should be allowed to rescind the contract and in this regard it 
referred me to the Misrepresentation Act, 1967. But it said that if I determine that rescission 
is not appropriate, then a further adjustment to the proposed compensation methodology 
should be made, which is that the interest on potential excess payments should be 
calculated from the date of respective payments. 
Creation responded to say that in the interests of bringing this matter to a conclusion, it is 
willing to accept the proposal I have set out in my letter. It also accepted the proposal by 
Mrs F’s representative as to from when the interest should be paid and has reworked the 
total interest to be about £950. It did not agree with the proposal for full rescission.

my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I remain of the view that 
Mrs F’s complaint should be upheld for the reasons given in my provisional decision and in 
my letter summarised above. 
I have taken into consideration Creation’s comments on the credibility of the evidence 
presented by Mrs F’s representative and the point that each complaint about i-Power should 
be considered on its own merits. In Mrs F’s case, the cumulative weight of evidence and 
information presented to me is such that I consider it more likely than not that i-Power 
salesperson misrepresented the benefits to Mrs F. I also remain of the view, for the reasons 
already explained, that Mrs F was entitled to rely on what she was told by the salesperson in 
deciding whether or not she should enter into the purchase and the credit agreements. And 
as Mrs F has suffered a loss as a result of the misrepresentation by i-Power and as 
Creation has equal liability for the misrepresentation made by i Power, it is responsible for 
Mrs F’s loss.
In relation to how Creation should put things right for Mrs F, I have considered her 
representative’s submission that the contract should be rescinded. A court might decide that 
Mrs F was entitled to rescind the purchase and credit agreements but my role here is to 
award what I consider to be fair compensation. I can also direct Creation to take such steps 
as I consider just and appropriate, whether or not a court could order those steps to be 
taken.  
As I have said previously, my aim is to put Mrs F as close to the position she would have 
been in but for the misrepresentation, taking into account her objectives at the time. In my 
view, Mrs F’s complaint is not so much about the solar panels themselves but that they were 
misrepresented to be self-funding. So removing the effect of that misrepresentation would 
put right the financial impact to Mrs F over the term of the loan. Further, both parties agree 
that it would cost Creation to remove the solar panels. So I don’t think it should be required 
to do that if it puts Mrs F in a position where the panels are self-funding. Allowing Mrs F to 
keep the panels may also enable her to benefit from lower electricity bills or FiT payments 
once the initial 10 year period has expired – as originally intended.
So I consider that a fair and simple approach is to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the 
potential savings (and income) to Mrs F from the panels over the 10 year term of the loan 
and simply rework the loan such that she pays no more than that amount over that term; and 
she keeps the solar panel system. 
I recognise that arriving at fair compensation is not an exact science, particularly in instances 
like this where some predictions are needed. But I remain of the view that my proposed 
approach would be fair overall, given the circumstances.
my final decision
My final decision is that Mrs F’s complaint should be upheld. In full and final settlement of it, 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:
(a) allow Mrs F to keep the solar panels;
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028
--------------------------

5
(b) work out the potential estimated savings over the 10 year period as explained in my 
letter of 6 April 2018, using Mrs F’s actual electricity tariff and the actual figures which 
have been provided for the electricity generated by the panels. As I understand it, 
this works to about £3,500 or on an average, savings of just under £30 a month;
(c) work out how much Mrs F has paid towards the loan. As I understand it, Mrs F has 
paid a total of about £10,200. This includes monthly repayment of £105 and the final 
loan settlement amount of about £6,700.
(d) Thus the potential excess payment made by Mrs F works to about £6,700 (£10,200 
less £3,500). This should be refunded to Mrs F together with interest.
(e) Interest should be calculated at 8% simple per year. It should be calculated as if 
there have been monthly excess payments by Mrs F and a further excess payment 
on settlement of the loan. On the former, interest should be paid from the date of the 
monthly loan repayment to the date of payment of compensation. On the latter, 
interest should be paid from the date of settlement of the loan to the date of payment 
of compensation. 
(f) Pay £500 to Mrs F for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused.
The remedy requires reworking of the loan as opposed to cancellation of the loan from the 
outset. Also, I have not seen any submission to indicate that Mrs F’s credit has been 
adversely affected as a consequence of the loan. In the circumstances, it is reasonable that 
the loan agreement is not removed from her credit records but the records should reflect the 
correct position after the remedy has been effected.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2018.

copy of the provisional decision
complaint
Mrs F is unhappy with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd’s rejection of her claim against it under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
background
In April 2014, Mrs F received a cold call from i-Power Systems Ltd (“i-Power”), a company that 
supplied and installed solar photovoltaic micro-generation systems and she agreed that its salesman 
could visit her at home. 
During that home visit she agreed to enter into a contract with i-Power to supply and install a solar 
panel system costing £8,000. She also agreed to enter into a 10 year fixed sum loan with Creation to 
fund this. The panels were installed soon after. 
In 2015 i-Power went into liquidation and in 2016 Mrs F made a claim to Creation under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the “CCA”). She said that the benefits of the solar panel system were 
misrepresented by i-Power. In particular, she said that i-Power told her that the solar panels would be 
self-funding but that isn’t the case. She said that instead, her monthly outgoings have actually 
increased which she is finding unaffordable. 
Creation said that, from the information available to it, it was unable to conclude that the solar panels 
were mis-sold or the benefits misrepresented. However, it said that during the year following 
installation, the actual electricity generated from the solar panels was less than what was estimated 
by i-Power by about 17%. On that basis it made an offer to Mrs F to reduce the total amount payable 
under the loan agreement by 25%. Mrs F did not agree.  
Our investigator reviewed the complaint and concluded that it should be upheld. She said, in 
summary: 
The key documents given at the time of sale were not clear, were incorrect and/or misleading. So it 
needed a good verbal explanation by i-Power to make it clear to Mrs F what the terms of the 
agreement meant, including what the costs were vis-à-vis the benefits.
However Mrs F says that during the initial call i-Power told her that the solar panels would be self-
funding, which was reiterated by the salesman during his visit to her home. What she closely matches 
the script that i-Power was known to use. Having considered the available evidence, Mrs F’s version 
of events is compelling. So it was more likely than not that i-Power misrepresented the savings that 
could be achieved, and this misrepresentation induced Mrs F to enter into the contract with i-Power.
The investigator said that to put things right for Mrs F, Creation should: 

allow Mrs F to keep the solar panels;

repay Mrs F the settlement amount she paid when she redeemed the Creation loan (about £6,700);

pay Mrs F £500 to reflect the trouble and upset this matter has caused her and

remove any reference of the loan from the relevant credit reference agencies.
Creation did not accept the investigator’s proposed outcome. It said, in summary:

the ombudsman service cannot accept at face value allegations made by Mrs F’s representative, 
who has a financial interest in the outcome of the complaint, whilst giving little weight to the 
documentary evidence which contradicts or conflicts with those allegations.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028


The contract, the solar panel system quotation and the customer satisfaction note all make it clear 
that the performance of the solar panels is impossible to predict with certainty and that the 
savings estimate is based on the government’s standard assessment procedure for energy rating 
of buildings (SAP). They also indicated that the savings figure was given as guidance only and 
the actual savings would vary according to the level of energy use.

The fixed sum loan agreement clearly sets out the loan terms. The agreement shows that annual 
loan repayment would be about £1,200. If Mrs F was told that the annual savings from the solar 
panels would be £600, it should have been clear that the monthly repayments due under the loan 
agreement would be much greater than the benefits arising from the system. 

The customer satisfaction note makes it clear that the estimate of the first year annual savings 
was significantly lower than the total of the credit payments under the same period and the 
estimate of savings quoted in any event was for guidance only. If it was given to Mrs F in May 
2014, after the installation, and she felt that the cost or benefits of the system had been 
misrepresented, why did she wait for a further two years before making her claim to Creation?

According to the information received from Mrs F, her annual electricity bill savings plus the feed-
in-tariff payment (‘FIT’) was about £800 a year. This was considerably in excess of the indication 
given by i-Power and what was stated in the customer satisfaction note. So there was no 
misrepresentation. If anything the benefits were understated by i-Power.
Mrs F accepted the investigator’s recommendation. In response to what Creation said, Mrs F’s 
representative told us, in summary:

The determinations of the Renewable Energy Consumer Code Non-Compliance Panel (‘RECC 
Panel’) dated 5 June 2014 and 10 December 2014 refer to systemic problems within i-Power 
which existed before Mrs F signed up to the agreement. Creation knew that ‘the business it was 
accepting from i-Power was toxic and was put on clear notice this was the case when these 
RECC decisions were published...’

Creation is liable for the acts and omissions by i-Power as a ‘connected lender’ under section 56 
and 75 of the CCA. It failed to monitor and audit the business that it was accepting from i-Power. 

It is not known how the solar panels would perform in the future or what the FIT would be over the 
next 20 years. So it is not right to say that Mrs F has not and would not suffer a loss. 

It generally takes consumers some time to realise that the solar panel systems were not 
delivering the financial benefits as promised and Mrs F made her claim as soon as she realised 
this. In any case she was within the time limits to refer her claim to Creation or to the ombudsman 
service. So the time she took should not affect the outcome.
Mrs F’s representative also provided several witness statements. These appear to be statements from 
various consumers who were also sold the solar panel systems by i-Power. In summary they say that 
i-Power misled them about the benefits of installing the system and their version of events is by and 
large similar to what Mrs F has told us.
my provisional findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
When considering what is fair and reasonable, I’m required to take into account: relevant law and 
regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I would consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028
--------------------------

In this case the relevant law includes Section 56 and Section 75 of the CCA, which provides 
protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. Section 75 states: 
" If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12(b) or (c) has, in 
relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier in respect of a 
misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against the creditor, who, with the 
supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the debtor.”.
As Mrs F paid for the solar panels through a fixed sum loan, 
As Mrs F paid for the solar panels through a fixed As Mrs F paid for the solar panels through a fixed 
Creation agrees that Section 75 applies to this transaction.  
This means Mrs F could claim against Creation - the creditor - for any misrepresentation or breach of 
contract by i-Power in the same way she could have claimed against i-Power, the supplier. So I have 
taken Section 75 into account when deciding what is fair in the circumstances of the case.
Section 56 is also relevant. This says that any negotiations between Mrs F and i-Power as the 
supplier are deemed to have been conducted by i-Power as agent for Creation. 
what happened?
If there is a dispute about what happened, I must decide on the balance of probabilities - that is, what 
I consider is most likely to have happened, given the evidence that is available and the wider 
surrounding circumstances.  
Having done so, I agree with the investigator that it is more likely than not that Mrs F was told by i-
Power that the solar panel system would be self-funding and would come at no extra cost to her. In 
reaching my conclusion I have taken into account the following:
Firstly, I consider what Mrs F says to be credible. She says she was cold-called and was told that the 
installation would be entirely self-financing. There’s nothing to suggest that she had any prior interest 
in solar panels before she was approached by i-Power. It is difficult to see why she would agree for 
the installation of the solar panels financed through a loan that would significantly increase her 
monthly outgoings which, she says, has put her in financial difficulties. I think it is unlikely that she 
would have agreed unless she was led to believe that the installation would be self-funding and come 
at no extra financial burden to her.  
Secondly, there are other indicators that support what Mrs F says. For example, Mrs F’s 
representative has provided us with a copy of a sales presentation which it says was used by i-Power. 
Looking through the document, it seems clear to me that it was produced by
i-Power. I see that the presentation refers to data relating to 2013. So, I am also satisfied that it was 
produced in 2013 or thereafter. 
As stated above the salesperson met Mrs F in April 2014. Mrs F doesn’t say that she was shown this 
particular presentation However, given that this appears to have been used by 
i-Power around that time, I consider it more likely that its contents would have featured at the sales 
meeting, especially as some of the statements made in the presentation are similar to what Mrs F 
remembers being told.  
For example, where it discusses the funding through finance it says: “The remuneration received from 
the Feed In Tariff scheme will cover the monthly loan repayments meaning you literally have nothing 
to pay and never out of pocket”.
The presentation also specifies ‘guaranteed’ / ‘minimum’ return of 12% in different slides. It further 
says that this is a “Pay as you earn scheme - 100% Self funding finance scheme means you are 
never out of pocket”.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028
--------------------------

9
To me this suggests that the solar panels were sold on the basis that the savings made from the 
panels would match the loan repayments during the term of the loan so that Mrs F was not ‘out of 
pocket’. This is consistent with what Mrs F claims she was told.
Mrs F’s representative has also given us a copy of the telephone sales script which it says was used 
by i-Power when it cold-called potential clients. I see that this is not disputed by Creation. In this there 
are a number of phrases that support Mrs F’s contention that she was told the solar panels would be 
self-funding. 
For example the script reads “…the energy trust have come up with a self-funding solar package. 
What this means is the energy trust will provide you with the finance and the system will more than 
pay off the loan, making the system self-funding. Once the finance is paid off you will still receive 70% 
off your electricity bill and a tax free index linked government guaranteed payment for a further 10 
years (20 yrs total).” This also suggests that the system would be self-funding over the term of the 
loan, and after the loan was paid off in 10 years, the system would continue to provide benefits.  
It further states that: “I assume free electricity and tax free income would be of interest to you”. 
Mrs F’s representative has also provided several witness statements, which it says are from 
consumers who were sold the solar panels by i-Power. I have taken into account the fact that these 
statements are all from consumers represented by the same representative and to that extent they 
have come to us from the same source. Also, I cannot be certain what actually happened in those 
cases. On the other hand however I cannot ignore the fact that what they say largely corroborates 
what Mrs F has told us. So I have given the statements limited weight.
Then there is the action taken by Renewable Energy Consumer Code (“RECC”). RECC got involved 
when it received several complaints against i-Power about the way it had acted in the sales process 
with various customers.  
As I understand it, RECC administers the renewable energy consumer Code and ensures that its 
members comply with the Code. The RECC investigated i-Power’s conduct and
notified i-Power of its concerns at the end of April 2014. Notably there were concerns about i-Power 
using false or misleading information and the use of pressure selling. 
The RECC Panel heard the case and decided that the allegations that consumers had been given 
misleading information about payment and payback were proved. It also decided that the allegation 
that consumers were not given certain technical information before signing the contract was also 
proved. The Panel therefore decided that i-Power was in breach of Section 5.2 of the code (which 
essentially required members not to provide false or misleading information to consumers) and 
Section 5.3 (which was about providing clear information to enable consumers to make an informed 
decision). It was concerned enough about i-Power’s culture and conduct to terminate its membership 
of RECC.
I acknowledge Creation’s submission that what happened in respect of those complaints may not 
necessarily have happened in Mrs F’s case. Whilst the RECC Panel’s findings are general and do not 
refer to Mrs F’s case, the findings suggest that there were conduct concerns in the areas relevant to 
Mrs F’s complaint and at around the time she was sold the solar panel system and the loan.  
In fact the Panel noted in its decision: “The Regulator was particularly uncomfortable with the fact that 
so many consumers appeared not to understand the benefit of the system sold. They were told one 
thing but the reality was different“ and that 
“There is a large volume of complaints with a consistent theme that suggest that some consumers 
have been given false or misleading information before signing contracts. …  The Panel decided that 
a fundamental cultural change was needed within the company…. Given the duration, seriousness 
and breadth of the breaches upheld… [i-Power’s membership of RECC] should be terminated.’”

I think that this information gives further support to Mrs F’s testimony.
Creation says that we cannot accept at face value accusations made by Mrs F’s representative 
because it has a financial interest in the outcome. I have taken this into account, but given the 
cumulative weight of evidence presented to me, I have concluded that it is more likely than not that 
the salesperson led Mrs F to believe that the solar panels would be self-funding and that the savings 
on a monthly basis would be sufficient to cover the repayments necessary under the loan agreement. 
what about the documentary evidence?
Creation says that due weight should also be given to the documentary evidence available at the 
time. 
It seems to me that of the documents that were provided to Mrs F at the time of sale, three are most 
relevant here: the i-Power contract, the fixed sum loan agreement and the quotation (Form 41).
I see from the copy of the i-Power contract that has been provided to us that this form contained a lot 
of technical details about the solar panel system. I am not persuaded that these would have been 
easily comprehensible to someone like Mrs F who had no prior experience of having solar panels. So 
I agree with the investigator that it would need a very good explanation from the salesperson to make 
Mrs F understand what these details meant. 
Further, it appears from the copy that some of the boxes like the ‘cost of electricity savings’ and ‘total 
savings and tariffs’ are blank. So I am not sure whether the form was complete in all respects. 
I also see that there is a section for Mrs F to initial which states “I fully understand how the SAP 
calculation was arrived at” and this does not appear to have been initialled.  
So, based on what I have seen, I consider that the form was incomplete and not readily 
comprehensible to someone like Mrs F. So I am not persuaded that on its own the form clearly 
highlighted to Mrs F the cost of installing the solar panels vis-à-vis the benefits she could expect to 
receive - in such a way that she was in an informed position to make a decision about buying the 
solar panel system.   
Indeed, I note that in response to the investigator’s opinion, Creation has accepted that “the SAP 
calculations within the document are not particularly clear or helpful.”
Creation however goes on to say that this is not relevant as “there is no reference within those 
calculations to the cost of the system or to the potential financial benefits of the system.” 
But this document is the ‘contract’ between Mrs F and i-Power. So, it is not unreasonable to expect 
that it contains information key to the contract. And if it is not comprehensible to 
Mrs F or is incomplete in any way, then it is not unreasonable for her to rely on what she was told by 
the salesperson.
 
Creation has also pointed to us certain wording in the contract which said:  “The performance of 
Solar PV systems is impossible to predict with certainty due to the variability in the amount of 
solar radiation (sunlight) from location to location and from year to year.   The estimate is based on 
the government’s standard assessment procedure for energy rating of buildings (SAP) and is given 
as guidance only.   It should not be considered as a guarantee of performance."  Creation has 
pointed out to similar wording in the quotation and the customer satisfaction note as well. 
I consider that this is a ‘standard’ warning that states that the performance of the solar panels is not 
predictable. Whilst it is inferable from the statement that the savings could vary depending on the 
performance of the solar panel, I do not think that Mrs F could have understood from this statement 
that the system would not be self-funding as she was led to believe.

Another document provided to me is Creation’s fixed sum loan agreement. As noted by the 
investigator, whilst it provides details in relation to the loan agreement Mrs F was entering into, it does 
not provide any information about the potential savings she could make either in the first or 
subsequent years or a comparison of the cost and the savings. 
Creation has also referred us to the quotation (Form 41). This form simply provides the total cost of 
solar panels. There is no information in the form about the likely savings or her potential costs over 
time. So again I consider that this document was inadequate for the purpose of clearly explaining to 
Mrs F what she is signing up to and/or counteracting any misrepresentations made by the 
salesperson. 
Creation has also referred us to the ‘Customer satisfaction note’. But this was not provided to Mrs F at 
the point of sale. This was provided to her much later, and after the cooling off period both for the 
installation work and loan agreement had expired. 
As set out above, I have concluded that it is more likely than not that, at the time of sale, 
i-Power told Mrs F that the solar panels would be self-funding and could be installed at no extra cost 
to her. I then need to consider whether it was reasonable for Mrs F - when deciding to enter into the 
contract - to rely on that representation or whether she should not have done so, given the documents 
provided to her at the time. I have also considered whether the documents provided to her at that time 
were sufficiently clear to correct any misrepresentation made by the salesperson. So I have to use 
care in giving consideration to this particular document, which was given to her after the sale and the 
loan was agreed. 
Nevertheless, I note that the key purpose of the document was to obtain confirmation from Mrs F that 
the work was carried out to a satisfactory standard so that Creation could release outstanding monies 
under the loan agreement. Although it says that the requirement to make repayments of the loan was 
not affected by the benefits generated from the solar panels, it does not show the repayments due 
under the loan agreement. It would therefore not have been easy for Mrs F to compare the two. At 
this stage, I don’t think Mrs F had enough information to appreciate that the salesperson had 
misrepresented the benefits of the system, compared to the costs.  
Secondly, as noted by the investigator, the savings figure provided in the document appears to be 
incorrect and so cannot be relied on. The export tariff calculation assumes that 100% of the 
electricity generated would be exported. But that can’t be right as the calculation also assumes 
that 50% of the electricity produced would be consumed by Mrs F.
Taking all of the above into account, I consider that the documents provided to Mrs F were unclear, 
incorrect and were presented in such a way that it would be difficult for Mrs F to make an informed 
decision from the documents without reliance on what the salesperson told her. So I consider it 
reasonable that Mrs F relied on what she was told by the salesperson at the time of sale. 
was the solar panel system self-funding at no extra cost to Mrs F?
In my view, for the solar panels to be self-funding and come at no extra cost to Mrs F, the monthly 
savings she would achieve ought to have been sufficient to pay the repayments necessary under the 
loan agreement. But did that happen?
Mrs F’s expected savings and incomes from the solar panels were due essentially from: 
(1) expected generation tariff income
(2) expected export tariff income and 
(3) savings to Mrs F to the extent she uses the electricity generated by the panels instead of buying it 
from the energy company.

Creation’s representative told us that this figure for the first year was around £800 made up of: (1) 
electricity savings of £600 and (2) first year’s actual FIT incomes of about £200.  
The first point to note here is that, even if this figure is correct, the loan repayments were about 
£1,200 per year and so the solar panels were not self-funding – there was a significant shortfall of 
£400  per year.
I see that the figure of £600 is simply a difference between two ‘annual projections’ made by Mrs F’s 
energy company. In May 2014 the energy company estimated that Mrs F’s electricity bill for the 
following year would be about £1,000. This was around the time the panels were installed. So it is not 
entirely clear whether this estimate took that into account. Then in May 2015 the energy company 
estimated that Mrs F’s electricity bill for the following year would be about £400.
Creation says that this shows Mrs F had a first year savings of £600 as a result of installation of the 
solar panels, but I am not persuaded by that argument.
Firstly, neither of these figures was available to i-Power when it sold the solar panels. In fact, the 
second figure was only available a year later. Secondly, the energy company’s figures were estimated 
savings at that point in time. But we now know the actual figures. So if Creation would like to check 
the first year savings in hindsight then it should use the actual figures. On that basis, I see that Mrs 
F’s actual energy cost during the year following solar panel installation was about £600 and not £400. 
But that is not all. Any change to the energy cost after installation cannot necessarily be attributed to 
the solar panels. Any change in Mrs F’s consumption or any change in the unit price will also affect 
the energy cost. Thus, other things being equal, if Mrs F used less electricity during the period after 
installation than what she would normally have done, that would also result in a reduction of energy 
cost. But that was simply because Mrs F used less energy not because of the solar panels. 
Taking all of the above into account, I am not persuaded that Creation’s figure of £800 is a fair 
reflection of likely potential savings to Mrs F from the installation of solar panels. 
I think that at the time of sale, the first year estimate as calculated using SAP 2009 would have been 
a reasonable indicator of the likely savings achievable by Mrs F from the solar panels. And though the 
estimate would have been for the first year only, I think that this is unlikely to overstate the 
performance of future years. If anything the performance of the panels was likely to deteriorate over 
time. Indeed it seems that is what happened in this case (see later). 
I see that this information is available in the customer satisfaction note. It shows  
that the estimated electricity generation during the first year would be about 1,800kWh each year. 
This gave an estimated generation tariff income of about £260. 
As regards the export tariff income, as noted by the investigator, Creation made a calculation error 
in the customer satisfaction note. It assumed that 100% of electricity generated would be exported, 
but that was highly unlikely because Mrs F would consume some generated electricity. 
So, assuming that 50% of the electricity generated would be exported (as per the assumption used in 
the SAP), the estimated export tariff income would be about £45. 
Using the same approach, if we assume that 50% of the electricity produced would be consumed by 
Mrs F, that figure would be about 900kWh. Using Creation’s assumed electricity price of 16p per kWh, 
the estimated savings on Mrs F’s electricity bill would be about £145. 
Thus the total estimated savings and income in the first year using SAP 2009 would be about £450 
(£260+£45+£145).
On the other hand Mrs F’s loan repayment was about £1,200. This means Mrs F was likely to be out 
of pocket by about £800 in the first year and that would broadly have been the situation during the

term of the loan. This meant that, even based on this estimate, the system was clearly not self-
funding as Mrs F had been led to believe. In fact if we consider the actual performance (as shown 
later), the difference is even bigger.  
Overall I have not seen any evidence to suggest that i-Power had a reasonable basis for saying that 
the solar panels would be self-funding and would come at no extra cost to Mrs F.
what would Mrs F have done if she’d been provided with the correct information?
I consider that i-Power should have clearly set out the savings Mrs F was likely to make and that 
though she would make some savings, her monthly loan repayments would be considerably higher 
than the potential savings. 
As noted above, and assuming that the estimates were right and the savings continued at that 
level for the life of the loan agreement, Mrs F would have paid about £800 extra every year for 10 
years.
After the loan was paid off, based on the same savings assumptions, it would have taken Mrs F a 
further 18 years simply to recover this excess £8000 (£8000 / £450).
If we allow for the lost interest to Mrs F by making this excess payment of £8000, then it would take 
few more years to break even. That means it could have taken in total around 30 years for her to 
simply re-coup her excess payment.  
But that is assuming she would get the estimated savings from the solar panels throughout these 
years, but that is not guaranteed. Even in the very first year the savings was less than predicted by 
about 17%. This not only impacted her electricity savings but also the FIT income she received. 
And if we do the calculation based on the first year’s actual generated electricity, the breakeven 
point goes well past 30 years. 
So the question for me is had Mrs F been made aware that there would be considerable financial 
burden to her for 10 years and then it would take nearly another 20 years to simply re-coup the 
excess payment, would she have agreed to purchase the solar panel system and the finance? 
I have already noted that Mrs F had no prior interest in solar panels. I consider it unlikely that she 
would have installed the panels without i-Power selling them to her. I am also persuaded that the 
reason why she agreed to the installation was because she thought it would benefit her at no cost 
to her. 
So, on balance, I consider that if Mrs F had been provided the correct information, she would not 
have agreed to install solar panels or enter into the loan agreement on the terms that she did.
In this regard I have considered Creation’s argument that the loan agreement shows that the 
repayment would be about £1,200 and if Mrs F was told by the salesperson that the savings from the 
solar panels would be £600, it should have been clear to her that the monthly repayments due under 
the loan agreement was much greater than the benefits arising from the system. 
Mrs F has said, through her representatives, that she was promised tax free benefit of about £600  
but it was not explained or understood by her that after making monthly loan repayments there would 
be no savings. So it is possible that Mrs F thought that she would make the savings after making the 
loan repayments. 
I have to bear in mind that Mrs F had no prior experience about the solar panel system. She got an 
unsolicited visit by i-Power and everything was discussed at a short meeting, and there were plenty of 
technical information. Also, there were several documents, which as I have previously noted, did not 
go far enough to make things clear. So I can see the possibility that Mrs F was overwhelmed by it all, 
could not understand the different figures that she was given and therefore relied on what the

DRN7440028
--------------------------

14
salesperson told her. I do not think that Mrs F would have entered into the agreement had she 
realised that it could take her a very long time before she could re-coup her cost. 
Ultimately, I am satisfied that Mrs F decided to purchase the system relying on the representation 
made by i-Power that the system would be self-funding. I have, for the reasons given, concluded that 
i-Power more likely than not misrepresented the benefits. So it follows that Creation is liable for that 
misrepresentation. I have not seen any persuasive reason as to why that should not be the case.
has Mrs F suffered a loss?
For the reasons I have already explained, I find that Mrs F has suffered a loss as a result of the 
misrepresentation by i-Power. As noted by the investigator, notwithstanding that the estimated figures 
were inaccurate, the system was not self-funding. Mrs F ended up paying a significant sum over the 
savings. In fact, as I note later, the difference is much higher when the actual performance is 
taken into account. And as Creation has equal liability for the misrepresentation made by i-Power, I 
find that it is responsible for Mrs F’s loss.
fair compensation
In assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider that my aim should be to put Mrs F in the 
position she would have been in but for the misrepresentation by i-Power. 
The investigator felt that a fair remedy would be for Creation to cancel the outstanding loan 
(outstanding as at the time she issued her opinion) and let Mrs F keep the solar panels. That way 
Creation would keep all the repayments Mrs F made to that date whilst she would get to keep any 
future savings she may make from the solar panels. To put simply, she suggested both parties ‘walk 
away’ from the agreement without having to do anything further.
As it turned out, Mrs F had already settled the loan. So the investigator amended her proposed 
redress and said that Creation should repay Mrs F the settlement amount she paid when she 
redeemed the loan. The rest of her recommendation remained the same.
Whilst the investigator’s proposed solution was acceptable to Mrs F, it wasn’t acceptable to 
Creation. It said that the recommendation seeks to allow Mrs F keep the solar panel system at less 
than 50% of its cost as well as continue to benefit from energy savings and FIT payments - which it 
considered is not a fair and reasonable outcome.
Our role is to help settle individual disputes between consumers and businesses providing 
financial services - fairly, reasonably, quickly and informally. Determining fair compensation is not 
an exact science. Here, my aim is to arrive at a fair and reasonable outcome that would put Mrs 
F, as far as possible, in the position she would have been in if i-Power had not misrepresented the 
position.
I think it is also important that any remedy ensures that, as far as possible, Mrs F isn’t left in a position 
of financial loss. This is because, in my view, but for i-Power’s misrepresentation 
Mrs F would not have entered into this transaction at all and so would not have suffered any loss due 
to it.
To that extent I can see what the investigator has tried to do here. In making her recommendation 
the investigator took into account that over time Mrs F would recoup the loss she has already incurred 
because of the mis-match between the finance repayments and the savings and may start to benefit 
from the solar panels. On the other hand, Creation would also benefit because it would get to keep 
the repayments Mrs F already made. And importantly it wouldn’t have to incur the cost of removing 
the solar panel system, which could be significant. 
So this would have been a simple, quick and informal remedy that would have also most likely 
ensured that Mrs F did not suffer a financial loss.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7440028
--------------------------

However, Creation has not accepted the proposed remedy. It argues in effect that Mrs F would 
benefit too much if the proposed remedy was implemented. I understand its argument but I do not 
think that its original proposal of reducing the loan by 25% is sufficient compensation given the 
significant difference between the savings Mrs F made and her loan repayments.
I think a fair and simple approach would have been to arrive at a reasonable estimate of the 
potential savings (and income) to Mrs F from the panels over the 10 year term of the loan and 
simply rework the loan such that she pays no more than that amount over that term; and she keeps 
the solar panel system. 
I think that Mrs F’s complaint is not so much about solar panels themselves but that they were 
misrepresented to be self-funding. So by removing the effect of misrepresentation, this would put right 
the financial impact to Mrs F over the term of the loan. On the other hand, Creation wouldn’t have to 
incur the cost of removing the solar panel system.
However, it seems that this approach may not be viable here. Firstly, Mrs F has already settled the 
loan - well before the end of the 10 year term. And she has settled the loan by taking another loan 
with a different provider with a different set of terms and conditions. Also, as I understand it, her new 
loan not only includes the payment she made to Creation to settle their loan but also a loan she had 
taken for a different purpose. Thus, whilst her loss in the Creation loan could be quantified, I can’t 
see that a simple remedy could be reached when considering that her solar panel loan debt now 
sits in an agreement with a separate lender under different terms. 
In the circumstances and in the absence of any other reasonable proposal that would ensure that 
Mrs F does not suffer a financial loss, I think that the fair resolution would be for Creation to:
 

remove the solar panels from Mrs F’s property at no cost to her; 

refund all the payments Mrs F has made towards the loan, together with interest. Interest should 
be 8% simple per year. It should be calculated from the date of each payment by Mrs F to the 
date of payment of the compensation.  

However I consider that allowance should be made for the savings Mrs F has had due to the 
installation of the panels. I have already referred to the first year estimated saving of £450 using 
SAP. However we now have the actual performance figures and so I consider it appropriate to 
use that information. Using that information shows that Mrs F’s average annual savings and 
income was about £300. 
Whilst the average savings of £300 is an approximate figure only, I think it is a better figure to use 
than the initial estimate of £450, as it is based on actual performance. 
So from the refund figure arrived at, a deduction should be made at £300 a year from the date of 
installation to the date of settlement or date of removal of solar panels whichever is earlier. 

remove any reference of the loan from the relevant credit reference agencies. As I said, it is 
more likely that had Mrs F been provided the correct information, she would not have agreed to 
install solar panels or enter into the loan agreement. So I consider it reasonable that Creation 
should remove any reference to the loan.
I am aware that Mrs F has now effectively transferred her outstanding loan balance with Creation to 
another lender and has been paying interest on that loan. So I recognise an allowance should be 
made for that too. However I consider that the interest I have awarded above adequately covers this 
payment and so I am not making any further award in this regard.

Mrs F’s representative says that Creation failed to comply with the provisions of FCA’s Consumer 
Credit sourcebook (CONC). In particular it says that Creation failed to consider whether the loan was 
affordable and sustainable to Mrs F. 
As I understand it, Mrs F has been able to make the required repayments under the loan until she 
redeemed it recently. So, on the face of it, it does not appear that the loan was unaffordable to the 
extent that she was unable to service it. Nevertheless, as my proposed remedy is to unwind the loan 
entirely, I consider this matter has been addressed in any case. 
Having said that, Mrs F incurred substantially additional cost compared to the benefits she received. I 
recognise that clearly would have caused distress and inconvenience to her. As the investigator said, 
Mrs F had to find additional money each month to repay the loan. Also I can see that the fact that the 
panels did not produce enough benefits to cover this cost must have been a distressing experience 
for her. And if my final determination is that the solar panels be removed from her home, then it is 
possible that she would also have to go through the trouble of having the panels removed.
Taking all of the above into account I consider that a payment of £500 to reflect the distress and 
inconvenience this matter has caused to Mrs F is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the 
complaint.
 
my provisional decision
Subject to any further submissions I should receive from either party by 6 February 2018, my
provisional decision is that this complaint should be upheld. 
In full and final settlement of it, I am minded to require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:

work out the payments Mrs F has made towards the loan. Add interest on these amounts at 8% 
simple per year. Interest should be added from the date of respective payments by Mrs F to the 
date of payment of compensation. 
From the figure so arrived at, deduct an amount to allow for the savings Mrs F has made from the 
solar panels. This should be calculated at £300 a year from the date of installation to the date of 
payment of compensation or date of removal of the panels whichever is earlier. 
Pay the resultant amount to Mrs F

remove the solar panels from Mrs F’s property at no cost to her

remove any reference to the loan from the relevant credit reference agencies

Pay Mrs F £500 for the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused.

Complaint
Mrs D is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), 
following a claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
Background 
Mrs D was contacted by a company, I’ll refer to it as ‘P’, which supplied and installed solar 
panel systems. Following a subsequent meeting at her home, Mrs D agreed to enter into a 
contract for P to supply and install a solar panel system costing around £7,300. To fund this, 
Mrs D also agreed to enter into a 10 year fixed sum loan agreement with Creation.
Mrs D made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the CCA via her representative. The 
representative said that P had told Mrs D that the solar panel system would be ‘self-funded’ 
and that her monthly loan repayments would be more than off-set by the feed-in-tariff (‘FIT’) 
income as well as any savings she’d make by using the electricity generated by the panels 
rather than buying it from her energy provider. But that hadn’t happened. Instead, the 
monthly loan repayments had been much higher than any income and savings Mrs D had 
made.
In its final response letter, Creation offered to reduce the loan and associated interest by 
25%. Mrs D didn’t accept this offer and referred her complaint to this service.
Following our involvement, Creation made an offer of compensation to resolve the 
complaint. It said it had worked out the potential income and savings to Mrs D over the term 
of the loan. It then said it would restructure the loan to ensure that she didn’t pay any more 
than this over the original 10 year term of the loan. As this meant that Mrs D had been 
paying more each month than she should have been, Creation gave her the following four 
options as to how she would like her overpayments to be used:
1.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and Mrs D 
continues to pay her current monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early,
2.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and she 
continues to pay a new, lower monthly payment until the end of the loan term,
3.
the overpayments are returned to Mrs D and she continues to make her current 
monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early, or;
4.
the overpayments are returned to Mrs D and she pays a new, lower monthly payment 
until the end of her loan term.
Creation also offered to pay Mrs D £100 to recognise the trouble and upset caused.
One of our investigators looked into the offer put forward by Creation. She was satisfied that 
it was fair. Mrs D, via her representative, didn’t. It provided its own calculation as to how the 
refund should be recalculated and said that Mrs D should receive a refund of around £9,000. 
This included a payment of £1,000 to cover the costs of a replacement inverter.
As an agreement couldn’t be reached, the case has been passed to me to review.
 
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7446337
--------------------------

Mrs D says that she was cold-called and during a subsequent sales meeting at her home 
told that the solar panel system would be entirely self-financing. As neither Creation nor Mrs 
D dispute that P misrepresented the benefits of the solar panel system this decision will deal 
with what I consider to be fair compensation.
The role of this service is to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses 
providing financial services fairly and reasonably and with minimum formality. In cases like 
this one, determining fair compensation isn’t an exact science. My role is to arrive at a fair 
and reasonable outcome taking into account the particular circumstances.
I’ve considered whether it would be fair to put Mrs D back in the position she would have 
been in if there had been no misrepresentation. However, here, I don’t think it would be fair 
or proportionate to require the removal of the solar panel system from her home. Rather, I 
think the fair outcome here is to put Mrs D in a position where the solar panels are self-
funding over the original term of the loan. By allowing Mrs D to keep the solar panels, I’m 
satisfied that she will likely benefit from lower electricity bills and FIT payments going forward 
(i.e. after the term of the loan has finished).
Mrs D’s representative accepts the principle of making the panels self-funding over the term 
of the original loan is fair. However, it doesn’t agree with the method that has been used and 
has provided its own calculation.
I’ve reviewed the calculation that Mrs D’s representative has provided. I’ve noted that its 
calculation doesn’t include any electricity savings.
So, I’ve gone on to consider whether it is fair and reasonable to take electricity savings into 
account when deciding fair compensation. I think it is fair to take into account the electricity 
generated by the solar panel system. On the one hand Mrs D has to pay her loan and for 
any electricity used in addition to that generated by the solar panels. And on the other, she 
can off-set those payments by the FIT income payments and the savings associated with the 
electricity generated by the solar panels. I consider it would be unfair to ignore the electricity 
generated and used by Mrs D when calculating fair compensation. 
I’ve carefully considered the methodology Creation has submitted to this service to calculate 
the total benefits of the solar panels. This methodology is based on the actual performance 
and estimated future performance of Mrs D’s solar panel system.
Creation has outlined that when calculating the estimated future performance of Mrs D’s 
solar panel system it will use a number of assumptions. These include a self-consumption 
rate of 37%. This is the amount of electricity generated by Mrs D’s solar panels that she is 
expected to use, or self-consume, rather than buying it from her energy provider. 
I’m satisfied that using a self-consumption rate of 37% is fair and reasonable in this case. I’m 
of the view that this takes into account changing consumer occupancy habits over the 
lifetime of the solar panels. Once the loan has been repaid, I’m satisfied that it is highly likely 
that Mrs D will continue to benefit from the system as a result of a reduction in her electricity 
bills because of the electricity generated by the panels and the FIT payments.
I’ve also considered the other assumptions used by Creation. These include electricity price 
inflation, the degradation rate and the estimated retail price index (‘RPI’). I’m of the view that 
these appear reasonable taking into account the actual known figures. As an example, the 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7446337
--------------------------

3
actual average RPI for the last four years doesn’t seem to be far from the assumed figure. In 
summary, I’m satisfied that the assumptions that have been used by Creation provide a fair 
and reasonable basis for calculating fair compensation.
Mrs D’s representative has also included a payment of £1,000 within in its calculation, to 
cover the cost of a replacement inverter.
I’ve looked at the current information available from the Energy Savings Trust. It says that 
solar panels don’t need a lot of maintenance but usually the inverter will need replacing 
‘sometime’ during the lifetime of the panels at a cost of about £800.
I accept that a consumer could have some maintenance and repair costs over the lifetime of 
the solar panels. The proposed approach to put things right for Mrs D is to make the solar 
panels self-funding over the original term of the loan. Once the loan has been repaid Mrs D 
is highly likely to enjoy significant benefit from the solar panel system by way of savings and 
FIT income going forward. In addition, the options proposed by Creation provide Mrs D with 
the flexibility to receive her overpayments as a lump sum.
Based on the available information, I’m satisfied that the potential benefit will more than 
cover any future maintenance costs and Mrs D has the option to use her compensation 
payment to pay for a replacement inverter if necessary.
Because of this I’m not persuaded that Creation should make an award for maintenance and 
repair costs.
In summary, I’m satisfied that the offer put forward by Creation to make Mrs D’s solar panel 
system self-funding over the term of the original loan to be fair.
By making the system self-funding, Creation has calculated that Mrs D should have been 
paying less each month than she has been. This has meant that she has overpaid each 
month. As Mrs D has been deprived of any monthly overpayment, Creation has added 8% 
simple interest from the date of the overpayment until the date of its offer of compensation 
and this is in line with what I would expect. For clarity, Creation has also given Mrs D the 
following four options as to how she would like her overpayments and associated interest to 
be used:
1.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and Mrs D 
continues to pay her current monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early,
2.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and she 
continues to pay a new, lower monthly payment until the end of the loan term,
3.
the overpayments are returned to Mrs D and she continues to make her current 
monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early, or
4.
the overpayments are returned to Mrs D and she pays a new, lower monthly payment 
until the end of her loan term.
I’m satisfied that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mrs D first 
contacted Creation that means her claim should have been upheld. The fact this did not 
happen has undoubtedly caused her trouble and upset and consequently I’ll make an award 
of £100 to cover this.

My final decision
My final decision is that Mrs D’s complaint should be upheld. In full and final settlement of it, 
I require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:

allow Mrs D to keep the solar panels,

estimate the potential savings and income to Mrs D from the panels over the 10 year 
term of the loan and rework it so she pays no more than this. Where possible, it 
should use Mrs D’s electricity bills and FIT statements to do this,

add 8% simple interest* to any overpayment made from the date of the overpayment 
to the date of settlement,

allow Mrs D to decide how she’d like her overpayments and associated interest to be 
used, using the four options described above, and;

pay Mrs D £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2020.

*If Creation Consumer Finance Ltd considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mrs D how much it has taken off. It 
should also give Mrs D a certificate showing this, if she asks for one, so she can claim the 
tax from HM Revenue & Customs.

complaint
Mr S complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) mis-sold his loan 
payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Mr S took out the PPI policy with a loan when he bought some furniture in September 2005. 
Creation and Mr S agreed that the sale took place in the store, and that Mr S wasn’t advised 
to take the cover. Mr S borrowed £1,578 for the furniture, and the PPI cost an additional 
£514.61. This was a single premium PPI policy, so the cost was added to the loan.
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. So if Mr S repaid the loan within that 
time he wouldn’t pay interest. After that, the loan was set to be repaid over 36 months, with 
the monthly payments including the PPI premium and a further £458.87 in interest on the 
premium. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr S’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And she didn’t think Mr S would have bought the policy if it 
had.
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr S was given would 
have made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr S’s complaint. This is because I agree with the adjudicator that 
Creation didn’t properly explain to Mr S how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr S to work it out 
for himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

There was a ‘statement of price’ which did set out the interest. But it was on page two of 
the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr S would expect it to be. And I 
can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a store and his 
attention was on buying furniture – not insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr S better understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr S aware of the effect 
the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t repay the 
loan within the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest at 
29.8%. This meant Mr S would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI cost 
for the first year, but the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7447672
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr S was borrowing. This was unusual and I think Mr 
S would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. 
Especially as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items. 
Overall I don’t think Mr S would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost him. So for these reasons, I uphold Mr S’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr S borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was higher than it should have been and 
he paid more than he should have done each month. So he needs to get back the extra he 
has paid. 
So, Creation should:

work out and pay Mr S the difference between what he paid each month on the loan 
and what he would have paid each month without PPI;

add simple interest to the extra amount Mr S paid each month from when he paid it 
until he gets it back (the rate of interest is 8% a year†);

if Mr S made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can deduct what Mr S 
received from what’s due to him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to deduct tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’ve decided to uphold Mr S’s complaint. Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 January 2015.

K820x#14
complaint
Mr P complains about the interest applied to his credit agreement with 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. And he’s unhappy about the entries on his credit file 
relating to this credit agreement.
background
Mr P took out a credit agreement with Creation in March 2017. The credit agreement was a 
‘restricted use’ agreement with an overall credit limit of £5000 where Mr P could make 
multiple purchases under one agreement. 
As part of this agreement, Mr P purchased an iPad. It held a special offer rate of ‘buy now, 
pay later’ which meant Mr P wouldn’t incur any interest costs if he paid this part of the 
agreement off before September 2017.
Mr P paid off the iPad agreement in April 2017; however the overall agreement wasn’t 
closed until November 2017 when Mr P requested this through our service.
In relation to the credit agreement, fees and interest, Mr P is unhappy that;

Creation’s system shows a monthly interest rate of 1.52% and an APR of 19.76% 
(without fees),

the agreement Mr P signed showed a monthly interest rate of 1.524% and an APR of 
19.9%,

Mr P believes 0.14% commission may have been exchanged between the broker 
and the creditor and he wasn’t told about this,

the interest rate wasn’t explained to him properly,

he wasn’t aware the credit limit was £5000.
And in relation to his credit file, Mr P is unhappy that;

Creation created an entry on his credit file in February 2017 but the agreement 
wasn’t taken out until March 2017,

the credit file shows no updates between February 2017 and May 2017 and then 
turns inactive,

the agreement was still showing on his credit file despite paying it off in April 2017,

the agreement was recorded as a ‘credit card’ which is incorrect.
The investigator who looked at Mr P’s complaint didn’t uphold it. In summary, he thought the 
APR and interest rate was the same but Creation had chosen to display it differently (three 
decimal points instead of two) on their system. And he hadn’t seen Mr P had suffered 
financially because he paid the agreement before any interest was charged. The investigator 
was also satisfied Mr P would have been aware of the type of agreement he had, and the 
overall credit limit. And he was happy that the credit file was showing accurate information in 
relation to the status of the account. And as there wasn’t an option for a ‘restricted use’ 
entry, he thought a ‘credit card’ entry was the most appropriate in the circumstances.
Mr P remained unhappy so the complaint has been passed to me to review.

my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
investigator for broadly the same reasons. I know this will disappoint Mr P greatly, so I’ve 
explained my reasoning further below.
the credit agreement, fees and interest
Mr P took out an agreement with Creation which allowed him to purchase multiple items 
under one agreement. I’ve seen the paperwork which was provided to Mr P and in particular 
the ‘Important Customer Information’ document. This clearly states the overall credit limit is 
£5000. I’ve also seen a statement dated April 2017 which was sent to Mr P. The statement 
gives details on the current balance, available credit and overall credit limit. Therefore, I can’t 
fairly say Mr P wasn’t aware of the credit limit he had.
I’ve considered what Mr P has said about the interest rate and APR. And I appreciate why 
he would be concerned the agreement he signed and Creation’s system show different 
figures.
The investigator has explained that there’s no regulatory requirement to display the monthly 
interest rate to three decimal places, however Creation chose to do this on the agreement 
itself. Because of that, the rate showed as 1.524% monthly interest. However, on their 
system it shows as 1.52%. I understand Mr P’s concern with this but I’m satisfied the overall 
rate is the same and the way it is displayed is different.
I’ve also considered Mr P’s comments about the difference in APR being paid as 
commission between Creation and the broker. However, I haven’t seen anything to suggest 
this is the case. 
I’ve found that there isn’t a difference in the interest rates being charged, however, even if 
there was, I’ve seen Mr P paid off his credit agreement before the ‘buy now, pay later’ offer 
ended. And therefore, I don’t consider the interest rate has affected him or the payments 
he’s made in any way. Therefore, based on everything I’ve seen, I’m satisfied Mr P hasn’t 
lost out as a result of any difference in interest rate.
the credit report
Mr P is concerned that Creation recorded the agreement in question as a credit card. I 
recognise the type of agreement Mr P has isn’t a credit card. It’s a restricted use credit 
agreement which allows Mr P to buy multiple items from the same supplier, up to the credit 
limit available. 
There isn’t a valid entry from the credit reference agencies which allows the agreement to be 
recorded as a ‘restricted use’. And taking into account the overall use of the agreement, I 
think it most closely matches that of a credit card. So I don’t find it unreasonable the 
agreement has been recorded in this way.
Mr P has raised concerns that Creation recorded an entry on his credit file in February 2017 
even though the agreement with them didn’t start until March 2017. I’ve reviewed Mr P’s 
credit file and I haven’t seen an entry from Creation in February 2017.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7457542
--------------------------

3
The entry from Creation started in March 2017 and until June 2017 was recorded as ‘U’. The 
credit reference agencies have confirmed a ‘U’ recording means unclassified. More simply, 
that means a payment isn’t due or an agreement has been recently opened. I’ve considered 
this entry alongside the payments Mr P made to his credit agreement and I consider it 
reasonable. I say that because Mr P opened the agreement in March 2017, and paid off the 
current balance in April 2017. Therefore, during this time I do find the ‘U’ recording to be the 
most appropriate.
From July 2017 to November 2017, Mr P’s credit file shows the agreement as ‘N’. This 
means the facility hasn’t been used. While Mr P paid off the iPad part of the agreement, he 
didn’t ask Creation to close the whole agreement until November 2017. Therefore, I find this 
recording a true reflection of this agreement’s status. The full credit limit of £5000 was 
available for Mr P to use if he wished to, but he didn’t.
As Mr P closed the agreement in full in November 2017 it’s reasonable that from this date 
the agreement is showing as settled on Mr P’s credit file.
overall
I know how strongly Mr P feels about this issue overall, but I can’t fairly conclude Creation 
have done anything wrong. And therefore, I won’t be asking them to do anything.
my final decision
So, for the reasons I’ve explained above, my final decision is that I don’t uphold Mr P’s 
complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2019.

complaint
Mr M complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold him a regular 
premium payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy in 2010. 
Mr M says he was unaware of the PPI. He’s said he didn’t need the cover because his 
employer would’ve provided him with sick pay for more than a year. 
background
In 2010 Mr M was 19 years old and employed with HM Forces. He bought some furniture in a 
store which cost £2,364. Mr M put down a deposit and arranged a loan of £1,000 to pay for 
the remaining balance. 
The £1,000 loan was taken out over a term of 10 months with a monthly payment of £100. 
Our adjudicator said the complaint should be upheld as there were significant terms in the 
policy which would’ve made it difficult for Mr M to claim due to the nature of his employment. 
Creation disagreed. It said the policy was sold to Mr M without giving him any advice to take 
out the cover. Creation said it was up to Mr M to check the terms of the cover to help him 
decide if he wanted to take out the PPI. 
The complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It seems to me that the relevant considerations in this case are the same as those set out on 
our website. And the main questions I need to consider are:
-
If Creation gave any advice or recommendation, did it make sure the product it 
recommended was suitable for Mr M’s needs?
-
Did Creation give Mr M the information he needed to decide whether to take out the 
policy?
If there was a problem with the way the policy was sold then I need to consider whether 
Mr M is worse off as a result. That is, would he have done something different – such as not 
taking out the policy – if there hadn’t been any problems with the sale?
I agree with the adjudicator that Mr M’s complaint should be upheld.
Mr M bought his furniture and arranged the financing for it in a store. The credit agreement Mr 
M signed included a section for PPI. Mr M did not agree to take out PPI at that time. 
Creation has said its system noted that Mr M hadn’t taken out PPI at the time he arranged his 
credit. And that it could see Mr M was eligible for the cover. Creation has said because of this 
it sent Mr M some documents to propose its Payment Plus Credit Cover. These documents 
included, an Initial Disclosure Document, Policy Summary, Statement of Demands and Needs 
and a pre-populated Payment Plus acceptance form. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7519059
--------------------------

2
Mr M has said he doesn’t recall the policy being sold to him. Creation has said it was sold 
through the post and that it didn’t give Mr M any advice to take out the cover. In the 
circumstances of this case, I have some concerns about how Mr M found himself to have the 
PPI after initially declining it. And I think it’s possible that Mr M may have understood the 
follow up paperwork sent by Creation ‘proposing’ PPI, was advising him to have the policy. 
However, I’ve not considered this in any detail. This is because even if I accept that Creation 
did not recommend the policy to Mr M, I don’t think it did everything it should’ve done. As no 
advice was being given to Mr M, Creation didn’t have to make a suitable recommendation for 
his circumstances. Instead it had to provide Mr M with enough clear information so that he 
could properly understand the cover before deciding to take it out. Looking at the available 
evidence, I don’t think Creation did this. 
Documentation was sent to Mr M, but I don’t think it properly highlighted the significant terms. 
The terms that were particularly relevant to Mr M were set out in the policy document – which 
was not one of the documents sent to Mr M. And I can see that it would’ve been difficult for Mr 
M to find these terms in the policy document as they were set out on page 15 of a 25 page 
document. I don’t think this is where Mr M would’ve reasonably expected to find important 
information. 
Mr M was taking out a small loan over a term that was less than a year. The cover he had 
through his employer was over 12 months and so would’ve lasted longer than the term of the 
loan. I think had the relevant exclusion been made clear to Mr M and he’d understood there 
was a real possibility that he wouldn’t be able to claim due to the nature of his employment, I 
don’t think he would’ve thought the policy provided value for money given his circumstances. 
So I don’t think he would’ve gone ahead with it. 
fair compensation 
Mr M should be put back in the position he would’ve been in now if had taken out the 
agreement without the PPI policy. I understand that both the loan and PPI policy have now 
ended. 
Creation should therefore pay Mr M the premiums he has paid towards the policy. And it 
should pay Mr M simple interest for each monthly premium from when he paid it until he gets it 
back (the rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year from then on†).
Creation should show Mr M how it worked this out. And if Mr M made a successful claim under 
the policy Creation can take off what Mr M got for the claim from the amount they owe him. 
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr M to take off tax from this interest. Creation must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax they’ve taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that Mr M’s complaint is upheld and I require Creation Consumer Finance 
Ltd to pay Mr M fair compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2014.

K820x#14
complaint
Mr F complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd rejected his claim under S 75 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 in respect of a sofa.
background
In April 2014 Mr F bought a sofa from a retailer with finance provided by Creation. In 
May 2014 he noticed the leather was peeling and there was a problem with the stitching. A 
service manager came out and inspected the sofa and said that this was quite normal and 
the solution was to paint the leather.
Mr F complained further to the retailer’s head office as he noted it was impossible to clean 
the painted areas and more peeling had occurred. A service manager inspected the sofa 
again and offered to repaint the existing and new problem areas. A further visit was made in 
December and the service manager agreed there were quality issues and offered to recover 
the cushions. Mr F says he had lost faith in the retailer and asked Creation to cancel his 
agreement and refund what he had paid.
Creation rejected Mr F claim as it said he had refused to speak with the retailer to resolve 
the issue. Mr F said he had not refused to talk to the retailer and he brought his complaint to 
this service. Our adjudicator recommended that it be upheld. She asked Creation to obtain 
an independent report which it did, but as the sofa was now over a year old it showed that 
there had been wear and tear. Creation had relied heavily on what it had been told by the 
retailer including an assertion that the sofa had been cleaned with non-approved cleaner.
She noted that the retailer had accepted in December that the sofa was faulty. The retailer’s 
notes state: “As previously said not all marks are manufacturing defects and have been 
caused by the customer…”. She asked for the retailer’s report from the December visit, but 
despite repeated requests this was not forthcoming. She concluded that there were 
manufacturing faults and so Creation should unwind the agreement and repay Mr F all the 
payments he had made.
She also considered that Creation had not handled the investigation well and she said it 
should pay Mr F compensation of £50. Creation did not agree and said the independent 
report showed wear and tear.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is surprising that leather should peel off a new sofa within a few months. I note that the 
sofa was an ex demonstration model, but was sold as pristine. The retailer eventually 
accepted that there were manufacturing issues. It did also say that the sofa had been 
cleaned with non-approved cleaner. Mr F denies this and says he used the cleaner he 
bought from the retailer. It would appear that there are no detailed reports from the various 
inspections and so I am unable to explore the basis for the retailer’s claims that the wrong 
cleaner was used. I am inclined to believe Mr F.
I note that the independent report which was carried out over a year after the sofa had been 
purchased showed that the sofa was suffering wear and tear. This is not surprising as it had 
Ref:

--------------------------

2
been used for a year. I note the retailer’s records show the manager thought it was being 
used heavily. I am not sure on what evidence he based this assertion. In any event the 
leather should not peel off after a couple of months.
I consider it sufficiently clear that there were manufacturing faults. The retailer has already 
accepted this and even if there has been subsequent wear and tear which has occurred 
while Mr F sought to have the faults addressed that does not mean that the manufacturing 
faults should be ignored. The offer to recover the cushions would not, in my opinion, be a 
satisfactory response.
Mr F was sold a faulty sofa and I agree with the adjudicator that this complaint should be 
upheld.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited to unwind the finance agreement and refund all the payments made by Mr F. It 
should pay Mr F compensation of £50. It should also arrange for the collection of the sofa at 
its own cost and at a time that is convenient for Mr F. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr F to accept or reject my decision before 
2 October 2015.

complaint
Mrs M complains that some replacement windows and doors that she paid for using a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance Limited weren’t of satisfactory quality.
background
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I won’t repeat them again here. Instead I’ll focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:

Mrs M entered in to a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance, 
that she electronically signed in October 2017, to pay for some replacement windows 
and doors – the cost of the work was £22,350 and she paid a deposit of £11,153 so 
the loan was for £11,197 which she agreed to repay by 60 monthly repayments of 
£286.07;

Mrs M complained to the supplier about some issues with the work so it inspected 
them and identified that some rectification work was required – but before the 
rectification work could be completed the supplier stopped trading;

Mrs M complained to Creation Consumer Finance and then to this service – and she 
stopped making payments to Creation Consumer Finance so her account went into 
arrears – she also paid £950 for the works to be inspected by an independent expert 
in March 2020;

the expert’s report concluded that the windows weren’t fit for purpose and that 
remedial work was required as described in his report;

our investigator recommended that Creation Consumer Finance should: make good 
the internal window boards and reveals due to the staining caused by rainwater; 
complete the rectification work based on three quotes that she should obtain; pay her 
£750 for the trouble and upset caused; reimburse her for the cost of the inspection 
report; and amend any adverse information recorded on her credit file;

Creation Consumer Finance has accepted the investigator’s recommendations but it 
says that it can’t remove the adverse information on her credit file until the arrears on 
her account are cleared – and it suggests that the compensation payable to Mrs M 
should be credited to her account to reduce her arrears;

Mrs M hasn’t accepted those recommendations and says that: she should receive 
more compensation; she should be reimbursed for the cost of decorating that she’s 
already paid for; she’s getting more leaks from the windows and more damage is 
being caused; it will take her a lot of time and effort to get three quotes for the 
remedial work; and the supplier guaranteed the windows for 25 years but she’s only 
being offered a ten year guarantee on the quote that she obtained for replacing the 
windows;
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7554807
--------------------------

2

our investigator agreed that Creation Consumer Finance shouldn’t be required to 
rectify the ongoing effect on Mrs M’s credit file until the arrears are cleared – and she 
says that she’s going to be making a claim for damages against Creation Consumer 
Finance and won’t be settling any outstanding amount until it removes all of the 
interest from her account;

in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;

to be able to uphold Mrs M’s complaint about Creation Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the windows and that Creation Consumer Finance‘s response to her claim under 
section 75 wasn’t fair or reasonable – but I’m not determining the outcome of Mrs M’s 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;

there doesn’t seem to be any dispute that there’s been a breach of contract – the 
supplier identified that some rectification work was required but has stopped trading 
and the windows were inspected by an independent expert who said that they 
weren’t fit for purpose – but Creation Consumer Finance has accepted our 
investigator’s recommendations and has agreed to pay for the remedial works and 
some making good, to pay her £750 compensation, and to reimburse her for the cost 
of the report; 

I sympathise with Mrs M for the issues that she’s been caused and for the continuing 
time and effort required to obtain three quotes for the remedial work and the distress 
and inconvenience that she’ll be caused by those works – but I consider that the 
outcome recommended by our investigator is fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances;

I don’t consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation 
Consumer Finance to reimburse Mrs M for the cost of the decorating that she’s 
already had done, to pay her more than £750 to compensate her for the distress and 
inconvenience that she’s been caused or to remove the interest from her account;

the expert’s report estimates that the cost of the remedial woks is likely to be 
between £10,000 and £12,000 (excluding VAT) so I don’t consider that it’s unfair or 
unreasonable for Mrs M to provide it with three quotes for the remedial works and to 
agree with Creation Consumer Finance which quote to accept;

Mrs M says that the windows came with a 25 year guarantee but a quote that she 
obtained for replacing the windows only came with a ten year guarantee – that isn’t 
something for which Creation Consumer Finance is responsible; 

Mrs M has stopped making payments to Creation Consumer Finance so her account 
is in arrears – if she clears those arrears I consider that it would be fair and 
reasonable for Creation Consumer Finance to remove any adverse information about 
her missed payments from her credit file – but I’m not persuaded that it would be fair 
or reasonable for me to require that the compensation payable to Mrs M should be 
credited to her account to reduce her arrears (but she can use it for that purpose if 
she chooses to do so); and


complaint
Mr S complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd has charged him interest on his loan to 
buy a carpet.
background
In June 2013 Mr S bought a carpet and signed a buy now pay later agreement with Creation. 
The terms were that he would pay no interest if he paid the total sum due by 5 June 2014. 
He paid the money on 16 June and so became liable for an interest charge.
He complained to Creation in June 2014 and it issued several letters to him including a final 
response letter which explained that he had six months to bring his complaint to this service. 
He contacted us in April 2016. Creation objected to us considering his complaint as it was 
time barred. The adjudicator explained this to Mr S and said she couldn’t address his 
complaint about interest being charged.
She did, however, consider his complaint about Creation pursuing him for the outstanding 
debt. She noted that Mr S hadn’t yet paid the interest element which was due under the 
terms and conditions. He said that he hadn’t realised he was signing a credit agreement and 
the salesman had hidden the document from him. He thought it was a delivery receipt. The 
adjudicator concluded the interest was due and that Creation was entitled to pursue Mr S for 
the debt.
Mr S didn’t agree and reiterated that he hadn’t been aware that he had signed the 
agreement and that it was immoral to charge £406.47 interest when he was only a few days 
late in paying. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We do not have a free hand to consider every complaint that is referred to us. The powers 
given to us by Parliament are such that we cannot act outside our rules. One of those rules 
says that, unless the financial business agrees, we do not have the statutory power to 
consider a complaint if it is referred to us more than six months after a ‘final response’ letter 
is issued. Creation issued its ‘final response’ letter on 23 June 2014, but the complaint was 
not referred to us until April 2016, and Creation has since objected to our considering the 
matter
I am, however, permitted to consider complaints made outside of the usual time limits where 
I am satisfied that the failure to comply with the time limits was as a result of exceptional 
circumstances. I have therefore considered whether there are exceptional circumstances 
which mean the usual time limits do not apply to this complaint. I am not aware of any 
exceptional circumstances that would allow me to extend the normal tine limits.
The only remaining issue is Mr S’s complaint that Creation is chasing him for the debt. It has 
been established that he owes the money and it is reasonable for Creation to ask Mr S to 
pay. If he is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot make the payments to Creation I 
would suggest he contacts it to discuss this as when made aware of financial difficulties it is 
required to respond positively and sympathetically.

K821x#15
complaint
Mrs K is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), following 
her claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
background
Mrs K took out a contract with a solar panel provider, I’ll refer to it as ‘B’, to supply and install 
solar panels on her home. The contract was financed through a loan with Creation.
During the installation of the solar panels a scaffold board was dropped on to Mrs K’s 
conservatory roof, causing damage. B accepted responsibility for the damage, and as a 
replacement roof panel was no longer available, agreed to replace the conservatory roof in 
its entirety. Mrs K says that since the replacement roof has been installed it has leaked 
causing damage to her internal decorations and furnishings. She supplied a report 
completed by a double glazing firm that said the replacement roof hadn’t been fitted correctly 
as it wasn’t suitable for a low pitch roof. B said Mrs K’s old conservatory roof had been 
leaking.
B has since gone into liquidation. So, Mrs K made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the 
CCA to Creation.
Creation looked into what had happened. It said that as the replacement roof was completed 
and paid for by B it didn’t form part of the original contract and it therefore wasn’t liable under 
s75.
Unhappy with this, Mrs K referred her complaint to our service. One of our investigators 
looked into what had happened. She thought that Creation was liable for the standard of the 
repair work carried out. To put things right she recommended that Creation:

replace the conservatory roof including the internal cills, skirtings and apron,

pay for any costs incurred for the independent report,

repair or replace any items damaged in the conservatory due to water penetration, 
and;

pay Mrs K £150 for the trouble and upset caused.
Mrs K accepted what the investigator had said. Creation didn’t. In summary, it said s75 didn’t 
apply to the replacement roof as it didn’t form part of the solar panel installation contract.
Because of this the case has been passed to me for an ombudsman decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I’d like to thank Mrs K for her patience whilst her complaint has been looked into by 
this service.
S75 states:
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7607973
--------------------------

2
“If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12 (b) or (c) 
has, in relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier in 
the respect of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against 
the creditor, who, with the supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the 
debtor.”
Creation agrees that s75 applies to the contract that Mrs K had with B to install solar panels 
on her roof. This is because the debtor-creditor-supplier, or DCS relationship, exists. Mrs K 
was the debtor, Creation was the creditor and B was the supplier. 
But it disputes that a DCS relationship exists for the replacement conservatory roof. It says 
that this was a separate contract between Mrs K and B and therefore it doesn’t have any 
liability under s75.
I don’t agree with Creation. Neither party disagrees that the conservatory roof was damaged 
when the scaffolding, that had been put up to install the solar panels, was taken down. The 
original contract to supply and fit the solar panels was covered by the Consumer Rights Act 
2015 (‘CRA’). The CRA sets out the goods must be of satisfactory quality and services must 
be carried out with reasonable care and skill. 
And within the contract that Mrs K had with B for it to supply and install solar panels to her 
home there is an implied term that the trader, in this case B, must perform the service with 
reasonable skill and care.
The scaffolding was required to install the solar panels and does therefore in my view form a 
key part of the installation service for the solar panels. I’m satisfied that the erecting and 
dismantling of the scaffold formed part of the contract between Mrs K and B. And B therefore 
had a responsibility to ensure that this was carried out with reasonable skill and care. 
Reasonable skill and care would in my view mean that the entire installation was carried out 
without damage to other parts of Mrs K’s home. As erecting and dismantling the scaffolding 
again forms a key part of the installation process reasonable skill and care would mean the 
scaffolding was put up and taken down without further damage being caused to Mrs K’s 
home. 
As it was the dismantling of the scaffold that caused the damage to Mrs K’s conservatory 
roof I’m not satisfied that the installation was carried out with reasonable skill and care. 
Because of this, I would consider this to be a breach of the contract between Mrs K and B. 
As there’s been a breach of contract I think it’s reasonable for Mrs K to seek reimbursement 
of any losses that flow directly from the breach. 
For avoidance of any doubt the contract I refer to is the one between Mrs K and B to supply 
and install solar panels to her home. And, as this contract was financed by Creation, there is 
a DCS link and Mrs K is able to make a ‘like claim’ against Creation. 
As B agreed to carry out repairs to the roof I think this also demonstrates that it accepted 
responsibility for the damage caused to Mrs K’s roof as a direct result of the failure to 
reasonably install the solar panels. Had those repairs been sufficient I might have found that 
was sufficient to remedy the breach of contract in this instance. However, Mrs K has 
supplied an independent report from a double glazing firm that says the replacement roof 
fitted by B isn’t suitable for a low pitch roof. As the wrong or inappropriate roof has been 
installed and this is what’s likely to have caused additional problems with leaks, I’m not 
persuaded that B has successfully remedied the breach of contract. As B is now in

liquidation, and therefore unable to rectify the problems, Creation is liable for rectifying the 
work that was carried out.
Creation has said that Mrs K’s old conservatory roof leaked. And it has provided an email 
from B to support this. On the other hand, Mrs K disputes this. Creation has said that as it is 
of the opinion that the old conservatory roof leaked, any work to rectify the current leak could 
be considered as putting Mrs K in a better position than she was in previously.
I’ve thought carefully on this point. Understandably, there is very limited information about 
the condition of the old conservatory roof. Mrs K and Creation disagree on whether it was 
previously leaking or not. I’m minded to agree with Mrs K that the old roof didn’t leak. I say 
this because I think it is unlikely that she would’ve entered into a finance agreement to carry 
out further home improvements if there was, what I would consider to be essential, repair 
work needed to another part of her property. In this case the conservatory roof. I’m not 
persuaded therefore the roof was already leaking or that Mrs K will be put in a better position 
by having a roof that doesn’t leak. 
Mrs K has said that the ongoing leak has caused damage to the internal decorations within 
her conservatory. She has already provided Creation with quotes to carry out the repair work 
to the internal decorations that’s required. This work includes stain blocking the damaged 
walls, repainting them and the woodwork within the conservatory and re-wallpapering a 
feature wall. As the quote provided is from a number of months ago I think Mrs K should 
provide Creation with a new quote to pay for the works identified above. I would expect a 
revised quote to cover the same issues as previously set out and be a similar amount, albeit 
there may be a small increase due to the passage of time. 
Mrs K has since provided further information and quote for the work that needs to be carried 
out from a double glazing firm. The information says:
‘Following on from this, the roof was not ‘repaired’ until February 2016. This resulted in 
permanent damage to the internal cills, the wallpaper, the laminate floor, and, not made any 
better by the fact the roof wasn’t installed properly (see photos).
The installation of the ‘new roof’ wasn’t fitted by a reputable company, and again this is 
obvious form the pictures that are attached. 
This conservatory, apart from the pvc frames on the walls, is beyond repair to such an extent 
that everything will need to be replaced to return the conservatory to its original condition, 
i.e. wind and water tight, which it hasn’t been for the last 4 years.
I would advise that the customer undertake the replacement works as a matter of urgency, 
and we can confirm that we are able to do this within the next 2-3 weeks. We would 
therefore be replacing the roof, the internal cills, the skirtings and apron, the laminate 
flooring, the ceiling and all internal plaster work which has been damaged due to the 
dampness.’ 
A copy of this information has been shared with Creation by our investigator.
Taking the above into account I’m minded to agree that Creation should pay for the above 
work to be completed. This is because I’m satisfied that the damage identified flows from the 
breach of contract as above.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7607973
--------------------------

Mrs K has also said that there has been damage to her home furnishings including heater, 
dining room table and chairs, a television and window blinds. Mrs K has been unable to 
provide any evidence, such as photos, to support this due to the amount of time that has 
passed since the roof was damaged in December 2015. I’ve thought carefully on this point 
and Mrs K’s testimony throughout her complaint. The damage and poor workmanship that 
has been identified with the replacement conservatory roof means I’m persuaded that there 
would have been damage to some of Mrs K’s home furnishings. And due to the amount of 
time that has passed I don’t think it is unreasonable that Mrs K is unable to provide any 
photos of the damaged furnishings as she has since disposed of them. She has provided 
this service with an estimate of the replacement costs of a new heater, dining room table and 
chairs, television and heater of £1,550. And taking all the points above into account I’m 
satisfied that Creation should make a payment to Mrs K for this amount. 
This ongoing issue has caused Mrs K trouble and upset. Having considered the £150 
proposed by the investigator I’m satisfied that this is fair in the circumstances of this 
complaint. This is because Mrs K has been left with a leaking roof and this isn’t something 
that she would’ve expected. 
In summary, I’m satisfied that s75 does apply to the original supply and installation contract 
that wasn’t carried out with reasonable care and skill. And that Mrs K is able to make a ‘like’ 
claim against Creation. Therefore, I find Creation responsible for the failings of B relating to 
the poor standard of work completed when the conservatory roof was replaced.
my final decision
My final decision is to uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of it Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd must:

arrange for the replacement of the conservatory roof including internal cills, skirtings, 
apron and internal decorations including plaster work and meet the costs associated 
with that,

pay for any costs incurred for the independent report and add 8% simple interest* 
from when the report was paid for until date of settlement,

pay Mrs K a lump sum of £1,550 to replace any items damaged in the conservatory 
due to water penetration, and;

pay Mrs K £150 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2019.

complaint
Mrs B complains that a recliner and sofa she bought using finance from 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd were faulty on delivery and should have been replaced.  
background
Mrs B notified the driver on receipt of the goods that there were problems and signed to this 
effect. The retailer has carried out repairs but Mrs B says the goods are still not functioning 
as they should as the backs have a manufacturer’s defect.
Our adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She said that under 
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, as the retailer had failed to replace the faulty goods 
and the repairs were not completed to the customer’s satisfaction, the lender must either 
replace the goods or if this was not possible, it should cancel the finance agreement, 
refunding any payments made, and correcting any information on Mrs B’s credit file. With 
both options she recommended a payment of £100 for distress and inconvenience. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Where the evidence is contradictory, 
incomplete or inconclusive (as some of it is here), I have based my decision on the balance 
of probabilities – in other words, on what I consider is most likely to have happened in the 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
I am not satisfied that Creation has met its obligations. The faults were reported at the point 
of delivery and the retailer has now agreed that there was a manufacturing defect in the 
recliner. Whilst this was repaired, the evidence is contradictory as to whether this left Mrs B 
with a recliner of the quality and functionality that she could reasonably expect. With regards 
to the sofa, which she reported to have the same problem, we have seen no inspection 
report despite a number of requests. As a result, there is insufficient evidence for me to 
conclude that there is no issue with the sofa. It does not appear that Creation has at any 
point inspected the goods independently, or assessed the repair work that was done. 
For these reasons, on balance, I find it most likely that Mrs B received substandard goods 
and is entitled to a refund. In addition, I award her £100 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I order Creation Consumer Finance Limited 
to:

cancel the finance agreement;

refund all payments made to date;

pay annual interest of 8% simple on all payments from the date each was made until 
the date of settlement; and

remove this agreement from Mrs B’s credit record and instruct the credit reference 
agencies to do the same.

complaint
Mr H complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd did not properly collect his direct debit 
payments. 
background
Mr H took out a finance agreement with Creation to pay for his car insurance. In August and 
September 2014 Mr H’s direct debits were returned unpaid. Mr H explained that he was 
having financial difficulties and needed to move his payment dates. He made a card 
payment to cover the unpaid direct debit. Creation didn’t tell Mr H that the direct debit was no 
longer active because it had been returned twice. This meant that no payment was collected 
in October and the insurance company cancelled Mr H’s policy. Because of this Mr H lost his 
no claims discount. He explains that he had to re-insure with the same company using 
finance from Creation because the cancelled policy affected his ability to get reasonably 
priced insurance from elsewhere. Mr H explained that under the new agreement he had 
another problem with his direct debit and it was collected twice in the same month.   
Our adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She thought that the 
problems with the direct debit could have been avoided if Mr H had been told the correct 
information by Creation. She thought that Creation should pay Mr H £300 to compensate for 
the expenses and the upset and anxiety. Creation agreed but Mr H didn’t think this was 
enough to compensate for all of the costs of the cancelled insurance.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Creation has agreed with the adjudicator that it should have told Mr H that the direct debit 
was not in place. It has also agreed to pay Mr H £250 for the first problem and another £50 
for taking the payment twice. I think this is reasonable and I can’t fairly ask Creation to pay 
any more.
Mr H explains that he has had to pay much more than this because of the lost no claims 
discount and because he couldn’t shop around for car insurance because of the cancelled 
policy. I can understand why Mr H is upset about this and thinks that Creation is responsible 
but I don’t agree.
The no claims discount is something that is given by the insurance company. Creation can’t 
re-instate it. I can understand that the cancelled policy had an effect on the price of Mr H’s 
insurance for the next year and Creation has already discounted the finance for the new 
policy by £70 to reflect the error. I know that Mr H explains he couldn’t get cheaper 
insurance elsewhere but I haven’t seen any quotes. I think the further £250 recommended 
by the adjudicator fairly reflects the extra costs for the year.
I can understand Mr H’s point that this is an ongoing problem because he will always have 
lost one year to count towards his no claims discount. But car insurance prices depend on a 
number of things and no claims bonus can be lost or reduced. I don’t think it would be fair to 
ask Creation to pay for this uncertain loss.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7629581
--------------------------

2
I agree with the adjudicator that the £50 compensation recommended is fair and reasonable 
to reflect the trouble and upset caused by not explaining that Mr H would have to pay twice 
in one month. But the instalments were due and so he hasn’t lost out because of this.
Overall, I think the £300 recommended by the adjudicator is fair and reasonable and I can’t 
ask Creation to pay any more.    
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of it Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd must pay Mr H £300. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman 
Service, I am required to ask Mr H to accept or reject my decision before 1 September 2015.

complaint
Mr P complains about the way Creation Consumer Finance Ltd handled a Subject Access 
Request (SAR) he made in October 2018. He also complains that it wrongly shared his 
personal data with a third party.
(I’m aware that Mr P disagrees with Creation on a wide range of issues, but this complaint is 
solely about his October 2018 SAR and the way Creation handled his personal data.)
background
Mr P told us:

As at October 2018, he had an existing credit agreement with Creation. A dispute 
had arisen in connection with that existing credit agreement. The dispute involved 
goods purchased from a third party, which I will call “C”.

He made a SAR, but Creation did not provide all the documents that he believes it 
should have done – either within the required timescales or at all. Amongst other 
things, Creation did not supply him with copies of correspondence between itself and 
C (and in particular, it did not supply him with C’s response to Creation’s email of 
12 April 2018). Creation also failed to supply him with copies of correspondence 
between himself and C.

Creation did provide him with a CD, which it said contained information relevant to 
his SAR – but the CD came without any instructions, and he was not able to use it to 
access data.

In addition, Creation shared his personal data with C without his authorisation.
Creation told us:

It processed Mr P’s SAR correctly. It sent him all the information he was entitled to 
see, and it did so within the required timescales.

It is sorry that it sent Mr P a CD without any instructions, but it did send him 
instructions very shortly afterwards.

It considers that the terms and conditions of its agreement with Mr P allow it to 
“contact and exchange information with partner companies [such as C] providing we 
have an appropriate reason to do so”. It is satisfied that it did have an appropriate 
reason to contact C in this case.
One of our investigators looked at Mr P’s complaint, but she did not uphold it. Briefly, she 
said:

She didn’t think Creation held copies of the correspondence between Mr P and C – 
so she didn’t think it was possible for Creation to send that correspondence to Mr P 
in response to his SAR.

She also didn’t think Creation received a response to its 12 April 2018 email to C – 
so again, she didn’t think it was possible for Creation to send that response to Mr P.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7656915
--------------------------


She accepted that Creation sent Mr P a CD with no instructions on it. But she also 
noted that Creation had apologised for that failure, and sent instructions. She said 
she was sorry to hear that the CD wasn’t playable on Mr P’s device, but she didn’t 
think she could fairly ask Creation to do anything more. 
Mr P did not accept our investigator’s conclusions, and asked for his complaint to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman. He also said that before any ombudsman review was 
undertaken, he would like “Creation to provide the FOS all telephone calls and [C’s] emails 
from archive, since SAR is incomplete…Creation stated in letters to me previously that 
certain other calls which have not been provided were listened to’”.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in July 2021. I said:
“Mr P has provided comprehensive submissions in support of his complaint. I confirm 
that I have read and considered everything he provided, but I will not respond using 
the same level of detail. I do not intend any discourtesy by that; it simply reflects the 
informal nature of the Financial Ombudsman Service.
There is very little that I can add to what our investigator has already said. It is 
impossible for me to be absolutely certain that Creation processed Mr P’s SAR 
correctly, but on balance I think it is much more likely than not that Creation did give 
Mr P all the information he was entitled to. 
Creation says it does not have all of the information that Mr P wants. Clearly Creation 
cannot disclose information it does not have. I have noted Mr P’s comments about 
phone calls being listened to, but I have no reason to suspect that Creation has failed 
to disclose information that it should have done.
It is unfortunate that Creation sent Mr P a CD without instructions, but I don’t think it 
would be appropriate for me to award compensation as a result. I consider that 
Creation provided instructions within a reasonable period, and it would not be fair for 
me to require anything more.
I am also satisfied that it was necessary for Creation to disclose Mr P’s personal data 
to C in order for Creation to comply with its own legal obligations (and consider a 
claim Mr P had made against Creation in relation to goods purchased from C).
I can see that Mr P and Creation have had various exchanges about Creation’s 
practical arrangements for dealing with SARs – for example, whether it supplies 
telephone recordings on CD or memory stick, and whether it could or should have 
used a particular delivery service for physical documents. As an ombudsman, it is not 
part of my role to tell Creation what its practical arrangements should be. I can 
consider whether Creation’s practical arrangements have caused Mr P financial loss 
or material distress or inconvenience – but here, I don’t think they have. Mr P was 
disappointed to receive some documents slightly later than he expected to, but I don’t 
think it would be fair for me to award compensation for that disappointment.  
In the overall circumstances of this complaint, I consider that Creation has treated 
Mr P fairly. I do not intend to award compensation, nor do I intend to direct Creation 
to take any actions.”

Mr P did not accept my provisional findings, and asked that they be reviewed. He said:
“Creation have not supplied every telephone call to myself, despite having to adhere 
to Data Security arrangements under GPDR and the former 1998 Data Protection 
Act. The “privacy policy” of Creation states they ensure a third party, in this case, [C] 
to use encryption to safeguard sensitive Creation customer data but this was not the 
case, as [C] were involved in a Data Theft notified to the ICO. If Creation may 
exchange data when I have a right of access to all telephone calls as Creation 
systems are Archived. 
Creation admit that telephone calls were made by me, and listened to by Creation, 
yet have not been provided via the FOS; in particular, at 9:54AM on 19 April 2017, 
this was confirmed in Creation letter dated 15 June 2017; the FOS have not 
addressed failures under Data Protection Act 1998 given these calls were made in 
the last six years, as I need these calls for possible future litigation against Creation 
itself, and [C] under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as faulty goods were purchased 
yet then not repaired.”
Creation did not make any further comments in response to my provisional findings.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have carefully considered Mr P’s further comments, but I have not changed my mind. As I 
said, it is impossible for me to be certain that Creation processed Mr P’s SAR correctly – but 
on balance, I have no reason to suspect that Creation failed to disclose information that it 
should have done.
I would not expect any business to retain telephone recordings forever – so the fact that a 
business possessed a phone recording at one point does not necessarily show that the 
business was still in possession of that recording some months later. I have seen nothing 
that suggests to me that Creation failed to disclose information that it should have done, or 
that it treated Mr P unfairly in any way.
I understand that Mr P may wish to take legal action against Creation or C in future. But the 
Financial Ombudsman Service is an alternative to the courts – it is not the first stage of court 
proceedings. Our purpose is to resolve disputes between consumers and financial 
businesses, not to enable them to obtain evidence so they may pursue their dispute 
elsewhere. The courts have their own procedures for the disclosure of evidence. Mr P will be 
able to use those procedures if he does choose to take legal action against Creation (or 
indeed against C or anybody else). 
I remain satisfied that it was necessary for Creation to disclose Mr P’s personal data to C in 
order for Creation to comply with its own legal obligations. In the specific circumstances of 
this complaint, I do not think it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation to make 
a payment to Mr P as a result of any data breaches associated with C.
Overall, I have come to the same conclusions as I did in my provisional decision, for the 
same reasons. I now confirm those provisional conclusions as final.

complaint
Mr M says Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold him payment protection insurance (PPI).
background
In 2007 Mr M bought some electrical goods in a shop. He took out a loan to pay for them. At 
the same time Creation sold him a PPI policy – the cost of which was added to the loan. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature, and Mr M wouldn’t pay interest – or pay 
for the PPI – if he paid off the loan before that date. Otherwise he’d pay interest on the whole 
loan (including the interest charged on the PPI) over the remaining 48 months of the term. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr M’s complaint, because he didn’t think Creation had properly told 
Mr M how much the policy would cost. 
Creation disagreed. It said Mr M signed the loan papers and took them away with him – and 
he could’ve cancelled the policy if he didn’t want it.    
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Mr M’s case.
I’ve decided to uphold this complaint – because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr M how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr M to work it out for 
himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did give a separate figure for the interest – but this was on the 
second page of the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr M would expect it 
to be. I also can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention; particularly when he was in a 
shop and his attention was on buying goods, not on buying insurance. And, in this 
particular case, the statement of price also seems to show a lower amount of interest 
than the loan agreement suggests was actually charged. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr M better understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement also wasn’t enough to make Mr M aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay 
the loan off during the first 12 months the whole loan, including the PPI cost, attracted 
interest at 32.4%. This meant he’d pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI 
cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover. 

The PPI interest shown in the statement of price was almost as much as the single 
premium for the policy (and the loan agreement suggests the interest charged was even 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7659046
--------------------------

2
higher). And the total policy cost was also high compared to the amount Mr M was 
borrowing to buy the goods. This was unusual – and I think Mr M would have seen this as 
important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. Especially as he was 
borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items and his monthly payments 
(including the PPI) were only around £50.

Creation says Mr M could have cancelled the policy after signing – but he was entitled to 
be told the important information he needed to know before he signed. I don’t think the 
fact Mr M didn’t cancel the policy afterwards means he was happy with it, or understood 
what it was really costing him.
Given his circumstances, I don’t think Mr M would have bought the policy if Creation had 
done everything it should have done during the sale. So I uphold this complaint. 
what Creation should do to put things right
I understand the loan and PPI have now ended. But Mr M borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, 
so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he paid more than he should have each 
month. Mr M now needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So Creation should:

Work out and pay Mr M the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr M paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.
If Mr M made a successful claim under the PPI policy Creation can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off, if he asks for one. 
my final decision
I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to pay Mr M the 
compensation I’ve described.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 February 2016.

complaint
Mrs R complains that Creation Financial Services Limited, trading as Creation, didn’t send
her a refund for the credit of £11.73 on her account, despite her written requests for it do so.
It also wrote to her about a PPI complaint which she didn’t have with it. She wants
compensation for her inconvenience and a refund of £11.73.
background
Mrs R wrote to Creation to ask for her credit card account with it to be closed in
January 2014 due to problems with fraudulent transactions made by a third party. In her
letter she asked for any cash back earned on her account for the month of January 2014 to
be sent to her, but she didn’t receive any money back. She calculated she was due around
£11. Mrs R wrote again to Creation in October 2014 and said that she was still waiting for
the cash back to be paid to her, but no money was received.
In February 2015, Creation sent Mrs R an account statement which showed her account was
in credit by £11.73 due to “anniversary cashback” of £11.73 being credited to her account.
Creation said that it didn’t have a system in place to show that an account was in credit, so it
said that it was Mrs R’s responsibility to contact it to arrange a refund. Mrs R wrote to
Creation again in mid-August 2015 to ask for a refund, but the letter was filed in error as a
PPI complaint, so no refund was made. Mrs R wrote to it again in late September 2015, but
this was also filed as a PPI complaint. Creation didn’t respond to Mrs R’s concerns until it
was contacted by this service. It then offered to refund the cash back of £11.73 and pay her
£35 compensation. It said that the compensation was composed of £30 for the three months
delay in dealing with the matter since Mrs R’s August 2015 letter chasing for a refund, and
£5 for postage.
our adjudicator’s view
The adjudicator concluded that Creation hadn’t acted fairly. She noted that Creation was
willing to refund the credit of £11.73, and that it had requested a cheque to be sent to Mrs R
for this amount. She also noted that Creation was willing to pay Mrs R £35 in compensation,
to be paid directly into Mrs R’s bank account. The adjudicator noted that Creation’s delay did
cause Mrs R some inconvenience in having to chase the refund. But she explained that once
Creation had become aware of its error, it acted quickly to send Mrs R the cheque and
offered compensation of £35 which she felt was reasonable.
Mrs R disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that she had first requested a refund
around 19 months ago, and that £35 compensation was not sufficient. She is seeking £150
compensation for the time spent on the matter and her inconvenience.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mrs R 
and to Creation on 10 December 2015. I summarise my findings:
I noted that Mrs R had explained to this service that she had spent a lot of time chasing 
Creation for payment of her cash back. She had written at least four letters to Creation to 
request the cash back, and when it failed to respond she was obliged to bring her complaint 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7660745
--------------------------

2
to this service. This had involved her spending further time on the matter to prove that the 
cash back had been earned in 2014 and that she had requested payment of this in 2014, as
Creation hadn’t provided this service with copies of the letters she had written in 2014.
Creation had explained to this service that any cash back earned on Mrs R’s credit card
in 2014 would have been paid into her account on the anniversary date which was in 
January 2015. It was unfortunate that Creation hadn’t explained this to Mrs R when she 
wrote to it to close her account in late January 2014. In that letter she had also asked for any 
cash back earned for that month to be paid to her. Creation had closed Mrs R’s account in 
mid-February 2014. As Mrs R hadn’t heard from Creation about her cash back, she had 
again written to it in October 2014 to ask for her cash back to be paid to her. I hadn’t seen a 
copy of the October 2014 letter, but I could see that Creation’s contact notes referred to it in 
its entry dated 5 November 2014. The entry had said that the account was closed but Mrs R 
was awaiting cash back to include interest and postage.
I couldn’t see that Creation had provided a response to either the January 2014 letter or the
October 2014 letter. I thought that it would have been reasonable for it to have responded by
informing Mrs R that the cash back would be paid in January 2015 to save her the
inconvenience of having the chase the matter. I also thought that it would have been
appropriate for Creation to have arranged to send Mrs R the cash back in January 2015
when it was paid into her account, without her having to send it another reminder. As it 
hadn’t done this, I thought that it should pay Mrs R £10 compensation for her time and 
trouble for every month since January 2015 that she had been waiting for her cash back 
payment. As Creation had said that it had sent Mrs R her cash back in November 2015 
(although it wasn’t clear that this had been received), I thought it should pay her £110. This 
was in line with the way Creation had assessed its previous compensation offer of £30 - £10 
for every month since Mrs R had requested payment of the cash back in August 2015. I also 
said that Creation should also pay Mrs R her £5 postage on top of this.
complaint handling
I could see that Creation hadn’t acknowledged Mrs R’s complaint or responded to it within 
the required timescales. Instead it had filed her complaint incorrectly in its PPI complaint 
files. And because it hadn’t investigated her complaint within the timescales, Mrs R was 
obliged to bring her complaint to this service. I thought that Mrs R’s complaint could have 
been handled better by Creation and that it should pay Mrs R an additional £50 
compensation due to the inconvenience caused due to the quality of its complaint handling.
Subject to any further representations by Mrs R or Creation my provisional decision was that 
I was minded to uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of it, I intended to order 
Creation Financial Services Limited, trading as Creation, to:-
1. Pay Mrs R compensation of £160 and £5 for postage, making a total of £165; and
2. Pay Mrs R £11.73 if Mrs R hadn’t yet received the cash back refund of £11.73. 
Mrs R responded to say that she was happy with the provisional decision. But she also 
wanted a refund of the £10 she had paid to Creation for a data subject access request she 
had sent to it in November 2015 to obtain the evidence she believed she was missing from 
her investigation.
Creation disagreed and said that its systems had been searched and no evidence had been 
found of any contact from Mrs R prior to August 2015. As no evidence could be found, it only 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7660745
--------------------------

3
agreed to pay compensation from August 2015. It provided account notes to show this. It 
said that it had sent Mrs R a cheque for the cash back at the end of October 2015.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have looked at the account notes sent to us by Creation. And I note that these refer to the 
contact note dated 5 November 2014 which I have referred to above. The contact note refers 
to Mrs R’s letter dated 24 October 2014 in which she confirmed her account was now 
closed. But she also said in the letter that she was still awaiting cash back to include interest 
and postage. The letter was forwarded to Customer Care. So, I am satisfied that the 
additional evidence Creation has just sent us shows that there was contact from Mrs R prior 
to August 2015, and it supports my provisional decision. 
The adjudicator also asked Creation if it would agree to refund Mrs R the £10 she paid for a 
data subject access request and it agreed to do so. So, I have amended my decision to 
include this amount. I note that the total amount to be paid to Mrs R is £175 in addition to the 
cash back refund if not yet received by Mrs R.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of it, I order 
Creation Financial Services Limited, trading as Creation, to:-
1.
Pay Mrs R compensation of £160;
2.
Pay Mrs R £10 as a refund of the fee she had paid for a data subject access request;
3.
Pay Mrs R £5 for postage; and
4.
Pay Mrs R £11.73 if Mrs R has not yet received the cash back refund of £11.73. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2016.

complaint
Mr U complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) mis-sold his loan payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background 
Mr U took out the PPI policy with a loan in October 2008 when he bought some electrical 
goods. Creation said that the sale took place in the store, and that it didn’t advise Mr U to 
take out the PPI. Mr U borrowed £1.346.80 for the goods, and the PPI cost an additional 
£561.79. This was a single premium PPI policy, so the cost was added to the loan.
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. So if Mr U repaid the loan within that 
time he wouldn’t pay interest. Otherwise the loan was set to be repaid over 48 months. The 
monthly payments included the PPI premium and a further £690.54 in interest on the 
premium. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr U’s complaint. He didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And he didn’t think Mr U would have bought the policy if it 
had.
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr U was given would 
have made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr U’s complaint. This is because I agree with the adjudicator that 
Creation didn’t properly tell Mr U how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the total cost 
included a warranty Mr U bought at the same time. And it didn’t show the PPI interest as 
a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr U to work it out for himself. He was 
entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the policy to be in the 
loan agreement.

There was a ‘statement of price’ which did set out the interest. But it was on page two of 
the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr U would expect it to be. And I 
can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his 
attention was on buying electrical goods – not insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been 
good practice and might have helped Mr U better understand what the policy was 
costing him.

32.4%. This meant Mr U would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr U was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr U would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items. 
Overall I don’t think Mr U would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost him. So I uphold Mr U’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr U borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was higher than it should have been and 
he paid more than he should have done each month. So he needs to get back the extra he 
has paid. 
So Creation should:
work out and pay Mr U the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would have paid each month without PPI;
add simple interest to the extra amount Mr U paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back (the rate of interest is 8% a year†);
if Mr U made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can deduct what Mr U 
received from what’s due to him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to deduct tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr U a certificate showing how much tax they’ve taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’ve decided to uphold Mr U’s complaint. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation I’ve described above.

complaint
Mr C and his representative are unhappy with the way Creation Consumer Finance Ltd has 
administered his account particularly that it didn’t set up a direct debit and has entered a 
default and adverse information on his credit account. 
background 
Our adjudicator felt that this complaint should be upheld. He said:

Mr C’s bank says the direct debit was probably never set up properly and it’s no 
record of him cancelling it. It’s more likely than not that Creation made an error 
setting up the direct debit. 

Mr C wasn’t aware of the direct debit issue or the default and he’d not received 
letters from Creation. When he became aware of it he contacted Creation 
immediately. It hasn’t given him copies of the agreement in a timely way. He’s been 
harshly treated by the late payments and default being recorded on his credit file.

So, on the basis that Mr C brings the account up to date, Creation should get the 
account back from the debt collector and remove the default charge and adverse 
information recorded on his credit file. Creation should also pay Mr C some 
compensation for its customer service.
Creation has offered £50 compensation for not responding in good time. It’s also agreed to 
amend the credit file once the account is out of arrears. If Mr C agrees to this it will recall the 
account and the direct debit will have to be reset.
Mr C says his bank has confirmed that Creation failed to set up the direct debit. He couldn’t 
have set it up as he wasn’t given a copy of the agreement until some time later. He still 
hasn’t been given a legible copy. The fault is entirely with Creation. Its offer of £50 
compensation isn’t enough. He’s prepared to pay £400 for the payments to date. He will then 
continue paying in accordance with the agreement and the remaining balance will be 
Creation’s compensation to him.
Creation doesn’t agree to Mr C’s proposal. It says it’s not proportionate. It believes its offer to 
amend the credit file is a fair resolution of the complaint.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
On balance I agree with the adjudicator’s conclusions for the same reasons and I think his 
proposed resolution of this complaint is fair. I also think Creation’s offer to pay Mr C £50 
compensation for failing to respond in a timely way is reasonable.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and I require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd:

complaint
Mr O has complained that Creation Consumer Finance Limited has not refunded money he 
paid for an alarm system. The company providing maintenance and monitoring for the alarm 
stopped trading in 2011.
Mr O is represented by a claims company.
background
In March 2009 Mr O took out a fixed-sum loan agreement with Creation for an alarm system. 
The total package included monitoring and maintenance of the alarm. In 2011, the provider 
stopped trading. Mr O was making monthly payments of £86.46.
In 2014 Mr O was contacted by a claims company who told him that he may have a claim 
against the finance provider. On his behalf, they submitted a claim to Creation that Mr O had 
been misled into getting the alarm fitted.
Creation did not believe the contract included a cost for the alarm monitoring and 
maintenance. They turned down Mr O’s claim. His claims company therefore brought his 
complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our adjudicator told Creation that she considered that the total amount payable included the 
servicing and monitoring of the alarm system. Therefore under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974, Creation was liable for the breach of the contract by the supplier. She asked 
them to refund Mr O money that he’d paid since March 2011, when the supplier ceased 
trading. They should add 8% interest to that amount along with £100 compensation. This 
was for Mr O’s inconvenience whilst the case was not being resolved.
Creation never responded to our adjudicator. This case has been passed to me to review.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 provides that, under a specific set of 
circumstances, a consumer may claim a refund of money paid to a supplier by a credit 
provider. However there can only be a valid claim under section 75 if there is sufficient 
evidence to show that the supplier:

said something about the goods or service being sold that wasn’t true; and

this is what made the customer enter into the contract; or

had broken the terms of the contract.
That means that I can only hold Creation responsible for what the supplier did if the 
company misled Mr O and this is why he entered into the contract. Or if I believe that the 
supplier didn’t meet the terms of the contract.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7784641
--------------------------

2
There is no dispute that the original supplier of the alarm system ceased trading in March 
2011: just two years after Mr O took out the loan. There is no way that they were able to 
provide him with monitoring and maintenance. I can hold Creation liable for this loss of 
service if I believe the monitoring and maintenance was part of Mr O’s contract.
Creation provided the service with a copy of the loan agreement which showed that Mr O 
took out a loan for £4,750 for an “alarm system and installation”. They feel that he is 
receiving maintenance and monitoring as a free add-on and therefore they have no liability 
under section 75. I do not agree.
Mr O’s marketing material shows he’s being provided with “24 hour monitoring day in, day 
out”. In addition he has an “ultimate unconditional guarantee”. And in case this wasn’t 
sufficient, his agreement with the supplier states that he’s paying a total package price of 
£4,850.
It’s worth noting that some of the written evidence in this case is difficult to read. For 
example the copy of the loan agreement and supplier order provided by Mr O’s claims 
company. Creation was able to give us a copy of the loan agreement that was clearer.
The price, £4,850, Mr O paid is very similar to what other people paid. Mr O’s agreement 
with the supplier makes reference under additional comments to “10 years free monitoring/ 
maintenance”.
I am in no doubt that getting monitoring over a certain time period was conditional on Mr O 
paying £4,850. I believe that the monitoring and maintenance is a central part of what Mr O 
was buying. I can certainly see that this is what attracted him to buying the package in the 
first place.
Overall I am satisfied that a breach of contract took place when the supplier was unable to 
provide the maintenance and monitoring service. And I can hold Creation liable under 
section 75.
I broadly agree with our adjudicator and what she considered was fair redress. Creation 
should refund Mr O money that he’s paid them since March 2011, and cancel the credit 
agreement. 8% interest should be added to the money he gets back.
I am concerned that Creation never responded to our adjudicator. This has meant that this 
case was not resolved as early as it could have been. I believe that this has caused Mr O 
inconvenience. I consider it fair and reasonable that Creation pay Mr O £250 for this.
my final decision
For the reasons set out above, my final decision is to uphold Mr O’s complaint. I instruct 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited to take the following actions in full and final settlement:

Cancel Mr O’s fixed-sum loan agreement with immediate effect, ensuring that any 
future liability is waived;

Refund Mr O all monthly payments he has made under this agreement since March 
2011;

Add interest of 8% simple on those monthly amounts from the date of the debits from 
Mr O’s account to the settlement date;


Ensure that no adverse information relating to this agreement remains on Mr O’s

complaint
Mr V complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold him a single 
premium payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy. 
background
In 2006 Mr V bought some furniture in a store and took out a £1,299 loan to pay for it. At the 
same time Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £488.97, which was added to the 
loan. 
The loan had a 12 month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr V wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise, he’d pay interest (including £436.23 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining term of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr V’s complaint. They didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And they didn’t think Mr V would’ve bought the policy if it 
had done so. 
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr V was given would 
have made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We’ve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and I’ve taken this into account in deciding 
Mr V’s case. 
I’ve decided to uphold Mr V’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr V how much the policy cost. I say this because: 
•
The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the total cost 
included a warranty Mr V bought at the same time. And the credit agreement didn’t 
show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr V to 
work out the interest himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information 
about the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.
•
The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr V would expect it to be. And I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his 
attention was on buying a sofa – not on buying insurance.
•
None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been 
good practice and might have helped Mr V to understand what the policy was costing 
him.  
•
The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr V aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t 
pay the loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, 
attracted interest at 29.8%. This meant Mr V would pay a substantial extra amount of

interest on the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ 
life cover.   
•
The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr V was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr V would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. 
•
I don’t think Mr V would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr V’s complaint. 
fair compensation 
Mr V borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been. So 
Mr V needs to be put back in the position he would’ve been in if he hadn’t taken out PPI. I 
understand that Mr V refinanced his loan. 
So, Creation should:

Work out and pay Mr V the difference between what he paid each month on the loan 
and what he would’ve paid without PPI.  

Work out and pay Mr V the difference between what it cost to pay off the loan and 
what it would have cost to pay off the loan without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr V paid from when he paid it until he gets it 
back. The rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year from then on†.

If Mr V made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what he 
got for the claim from the amount it owes him.  
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr V a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that Mr V’s complaint is upheld. And Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
must calculate and pay Mr V fair compensation as I’ve set out above. I make no further 
award against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.

complaint
Mr M complains about his application for credit through Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
being declined. 
background
When shopping for a new laptop it was suggested by the retailer that Mr M should consider 
purchasing the laptop on a hire purchase agreement. Mr M agreed but his application was 
declined. Mr M says he has a very good credit record and is unhappy that his application 
was declined. He wants Creation to apologise for the affect this had on his reputation and 
the inconvenience it has caused. 
Mr M referred his complaint to our service after complaining to Creation. His complaint was 
considered by an adjudicator, but she did not recommend the complaint be upheld. She 
explained that it was for businesses to decide who they would lend to and this was down to 
their commercial judgement. She noted that Creation did say why the application had been 
declined but that it was not required to give a detailed explanation. 
Mr M remained unhappy with the adjudicator’s findings and asked for the complaint to be 
reviewed. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the same 
overall conclusions as the adjudicator for what are broadly the same reasons. 
Credit providers are entitled to use their commercial judgement when making lending 
decisions. We would not usually seek to interfere with a bank’s lending decision, unless 
there has been a mistake in assessing the application. It is not for me or this service to 
therefore say who a credit provider should lend to. 
Creation has provided a reasonable explanation as to why Mr M’s application for the hire 
purchase agreement was declined. I appreciate Mr M is unhappy with this response but 
Creation is not obliged to provide any additional or more detailed explanation.
I fully understand Mr M’s strength of feeling and his disappointment about not being granted 
credit. But after careful consideration, I do not find that Creation has acted unfairly or 
unreasonably by not granting the credit. I find that Creation exercised its legitimate 
commercial judgement in declining to lend the money and there are no grounds to instruct 
Creation to do anything more than it has already done. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint and I make no award or instruction 
against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.

complaint
Mr G complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited will not pay for replacement 
wardrobe doors. His complaint is made against Creation Consumer Finance under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
background
Some fitted wardrobes were supplied to Mr G which he financed using a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Creation Consumer Finance. He did not like the look of the wardrobe doors 
so he complained to the supplier, and then to Creation Consumer Finance under section 75. 
He was not satisfied with Creation Consumer Finance’s response so complained to this 
service.
The adjudicator did not recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She concluded 
that the supplier had not made an error and that, as this was a case of Mr G not liking the 
doors, she could not ask Creation Consumer Finance to pay for replacement doors.
Mr G has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that he is very unhappy with the look of the doors that have been fitted and it will cost a lot 
for him to change them.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if there has been a breach of contract 
or misrepresentation by the supplier. To be able to uphold Mr G’s complaint about Creation 
Consumer Finance under section 75, I must be satisfied that there has been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the wardrobe doors.
Mr G ordered fitted wardrobes for his spare bedroom from the supplier. He wanted glass 
sliding doors but the supplier said that it did not stock them in the size needed for the room 
so it suggested an alternative, to which Mr G agreed. When the wardrobes had been fitted, 
Mr G disliked the look of the doors and he complained to the supplier. The supplier 
inspected the doors and concluded that the doors had been fitted correctly.
It has now found a supplier for the type of doors that Mr G would like but they would need to 
be specially ordered and, because of their weight, an extra person would be needed to fit 
them. It says that the replacement cost would therefore be £1,500 which Mr G would have to 
pay. Mr G does not consider that he should have to pay £1,500 to have the doors replaced.
I consider that the wardrobe doors that have been supplied to Mr G are the doors that he 
ordered. Although he does not like the doors, I am not persuaded that there has been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier. I therefore do not consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer Finance to pay for the 
replacement doors or to pay any other compensation to Mr G under section 75.
The supplier has found doors that Mr G would like but says that he would have to pay for 
those doors, including the fitting. I do not consider that to be unreasonable in these

circumstances. Nor do I consider that Creation Consumer Finance has dealt with Mr G’s 
complaint incorrectly.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I do not uphold Mr G’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2015.

complaint
Mr L complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) has not responded to his 
complaint and has made errors on his account. Mr L also considers the credit agreement is 
unenforceable.
background
Mr L bought some furniture with the assistance of a finance agreement from Creation. The 
table he bought was faulty and it was returned. Mr L brought a complaint to this service 
which was resolved on the basis that Creation did the following:
1. Remove the cost of the table from the credit agreement;
2. Remove any interest in respect of the cost of the table from the credit agreement;
3. Ensure that Mr L’s credit file has not been adversely affected as a result of the 
matter; and
4.
Pay Mr L £50 for any distress and inconvenience caused.
Creation deducted an amount from the credit agreement which, it says, is the cost of the 
table. The agreement does not attract interest so there was no action to be taken by 
Creation in relation to this aspect. Mr L had been making reduced payments to Creation to 
reflect the issues with the table. Because of this, adverse information had been recorded on 
his credit file. These entries were removed by Creation. The £50 compensation was initially 
paid to Mr L’s finance account, but later he was sent a cheque.
Mr L complained to Creation after he received a letter telling him his account was in arrears. 
In his letter he explained that the agreement was unenforceable, as some of the goods had 
been returned to the shop. Mr L said that there were no arrears on the account and the 
amount that was outstanding was not correct. Creation acknowledged the complaint, but 
Mr L says that it did not respond fully and Mr L complained to this service. 
The adjudicator did not recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He considered that 
the amount deducted from the credit agreement by Creation was correct. He concluded that 
Creation had responded to Mr L’s complaint, because it was in correspondence with this 
service about the initial complaint at the same time, which was resolved. The adjudicator 
explained that it is not our role to decide the enforceability of credit agreements.
Mr L did not agree and responded to say, in summary, that the amount refunded for the table 
is incorrect and Creation has failed to properly calculate the amount owed and take account 
of his payments. Mr L says that Creation has not responded to his complaints and he has 
been considerably inconvenienced.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and everything that Mr L and Creation have said 
and provided in order to decide what is fair and reasonable in this complaint.
Taking into account the discount that Mr L received on the total order and apportioning it to 
the cost of the table, I consider that Creation has correctly calculated the amount to be 
deducted from the credit agreement in respect of the table. I do not consider that it would be 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7811485
--------------------------

2
fair or reasonable for the full cost of the table to be deducted, because Mr L did not pay that 
amount for it.
I have considered the initial balance, deducted the discounted amount of the table and 
Mr L’s payments to date. I cannot conclude that Creation has made any error in calculating 
the amount outstanding under the credit agreement, or that the figures are incorrect. The 
amount deducted by Creation for Mr L’s payments is the same figure that Mr L says in his 
letter that he has paid.
 
Charges have been added to the account because Mr L did not pay anything towards the 
outstanding balance, after the amount for the table was deducted. Two charges of £100 
have been removed, but one has remained on the account. Mr L has not made any payment 
towards the outstanding balance for an extended period. The charge is in line with the 
amount set out in the terms and conditions. I do not consider that it is fair or reasonable to 
order Creation to refund the charge in these circumstances.
As explained by the adjudicator, decisions on whether a credit agreement is enforceable are 
made by a court, rather than by us. I make no finding in relation to this matter.  
Mr L has said that Creation did not respond to his complaint. Creation was in 
correspondence with this service at the relevant time and provided information about the 
account and the calculations. When it was clear that Mr L remained unhappy with the 
responses and there were further complaints, Creation responded. I consider that Creation 
has attempted to deal with Mr L’s complaints. I am unable to conclude in these 
circumstances that Creation has made any error. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.

complaint
Mr Q had a loan from Creation Consumer Finance Ltd, which he says he repaid in full using 
his credit card. He complains that Creation does not accept the loan has been settled, and is 
still seeking payment from him. 
background
Mr Q said:

His understanding was that Creation would apply a £4 handling charge to his 
payment, made in July 2011, but found that the charge was 4% (a difference of 
£15.06)

He requested a £15.06 refund from Creation, but this was refused

He then contacted his credit card provider, who obtained a £15.06 refund for him in 
September 2011 using chargeback

Creation contacted him in July 2012, saying that he owed it over £600

He has credit card statements showing that he repaid the loan plus a handling 
charge, and later received a £15.06 refund

He sent this evidence to Creation in August 2012
Creation said:

It sent a final response letter to Mr Q in September 2012, saying that it received a 
chargeback request for the full payment he made in July 2011 (just under £500), 
which it actioned, and that it appeared an error may have been made by Mr Q’s card 
provider

It recommended that Mr Q contacted his card provider to resolve this matter
Mr Q referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service in December 2012. 
Creation provided a letter from its bank, which showed a chargeback request for the full 
payment made by Mr Q. However, his card provider’s bank provided evidence showing the 
initial full payment and a £15.06 chargeback. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld. He said that the problem appeared 
to have been caused by Creation’s bank, which had incorrectly stated that the chargeback 
request was for the full payment. 
Our adjudicator added that, in any event, the problem was not of Mr Q’s making, and he 
should not be disadvantaged as a result. As a result of this error, Mr Q had been chased for 
a payment he had already made, causing him a great deal of distress and inconvenience.
Our adjudicator recommended that Creation should:

Write off the debt

Ensure that Mr Q’s credit file correctly reflects his settlement of the loan in July 2011, 
and that no adverse data has been recorded after this date

Pay compensation of £250 to Mr Q for distress and inconvenience
Creation did not agree that it should write off the debt, or remove adverse information from 
Mr Q’s credit file. It said that a chargeback payment for the full amount had been made to his 
card provider’s bank, and that it was unable to recall these funds. However, it would be

willing to amend his credit file, and to remove interest charges applied to the debt, if he 
repaid his loan. It would also be willing to pay the compensation recommended. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Where evidence is incomplete, 
inconsistent or contradictory (as some of it is here), I reach my decision on the balance of 
probabilities – in other words, what I consider most likely to have happened in light of the 
available evidence and wider circumstances.
On balance, I find the evidence provided by the card provider’s bank stronger than that 
provided by Creation’s bank. Therefore, I find that I have come to the same conclusion as 
our adjudicator, for the same reasons. Mr Q should be returned to the position he was in, 
before this problem arose. He should also be compensated for the distress and 
inconvenience this problem has caused him. 
There is a technical note about distress and inconvenience on our public website, in which 
cases are described where we have awarded modest compensation (below £300). I feel that 
compensation of £250 in this instance (as recommended by our adjudicator) is consistent 
with those case descriptions and awards, and is appropriate given the circumstances of 
Mr Q’s complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and 
final settlement of it, I order Creation Consumer Finance Ltd:
1.
To write off the debt it has attributed to Mr Q,
2.
To ensure that Mr Q’s credit file correctly reflects his settlement of the loan in 
July 2011, and that no adverse data relating to his loan has been recorded after this 
date,
3.
To pay compensation of £250 directly to Mr Q,

complaint
Mr A, represented by Mrs A, complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd continued to 
record information on his credit file after the settlement amount on his fixed sum loan 
agreement had been paid.
background
Mrs A says that Mr A part exchanged his vehicle and the settlement amount due under his 
agreement was paid. However, a number of months later Mr A checked his credit file and 
there was still an outstanding amount recorded by the business. Mrs A says that she was 
then told that the incorrect settlement amount had been paid. She says she had a copy of 
the settlement amount that the business had provided which proved the correct amount had 
been paid.
 
The business says that it accepted a mistake had been made but says that it has done 
enough to put Mr A back in the position he would have been had the mistake not been 
made. It says it requested that Mr A’s credit file be amended to show settlement on 23 May 
2016, it waived the interest and the account was closed. It says that Mr A was provided with 
£30 compensation in recognition of the calls made but as Mrs A did not consider this enough 
it offered to pay a total of £75 compensation. 
The adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. He said our role is not to punish the business 
but where a mistake has been made to ensure the customer is put back in the position they 
would have been had the mistake not been made. He said that that the business had made 
a reasonable attempt to do this. He noted the concerns about the impact the issue had on 
Mr A’s credit file before the correction was made but said that we would need to see 
evidence of consequential losses to consider this further.
Mrs A did not accept the adjudicator’s view. She said that had she not flagged the issue with 
the business the debt would still show on Mr A’s credit file and he would have become liable 
for it again at some point in the future. She said the account was only closed because she 
raised the issue. Mrs A also said that the £30 payment appeared in the account without any 
notification or communication.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In this case a mistake was made and the business has accepted this. I appreciate Mrs A’s 
comments that had she not raised the issue then the outstanding amount could have 
continued to be reported on Mr A’s credit file and that they may have been chased for this at 
a later date. However the issue was reported by Mrs A and action taken by the business and 
it is this situation I have to consider.  
Where a mistake has been made, my role is to ensure that the customer is put back in the 
position they would have been had the mistake not been made and, where appropriate, to 
award compensation.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7813498
--------------------------

2
This issue arose because the business provided a wrong settlement figure. Mr A paid the 
settlement figure he was provided with within the timeframe. However, following this 
payment, information was still recorded on this credit file in regard to the loan.
The business accepted that it had made a mistake and said that it would amend Mr A’s 
credit file to reflect the correct settlement date. The account was closed with the settlement 
amount paid clearing the loan. I also note that the business has said some interest was 
waived. Based on these actions I find that the business has done enough to put Mr A back in 
the position he would have been had the mistake not been made.
Mrs A says that they should be compensated for this issue. I can understand why she says 
this. However, I have no evidence to suggest that the information recorded on Mr A’s credit 
file caused him any financial loss. 
I accept that Mrs A had to contact the business about this issue and I find it reasonable that 
the business paid £30 to cover the cost of calls. I also note that the settlement amount paid 
was less than the amount that would have needed to be paid had the correct figure been 
provided by the business. The business also offered a further £45 compensation.
Overall I find that the business has acted reasonably in this case and that based on the 
information I have seen, I find that Mr A has been put back in the position he would have 
been had the mistake not been made.
I find that the actions already taken by the business have been fair and I do not require it to 
do anything further to settle this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2017.

complaint
Miss M complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd wrongly said she had cancelled a 
direct debit for payments to her loan account and referred it to debt collectors without 
contacting her. She also complains about its lack of response to her complaint.
background
In November 2014 Miss M’s direct debit was cancelled. Creation wrote to her about that, but 
when it got no response it referred matters to debt collectors. They managed to contact her 
in February 2015. She contacted Creation and said she had not cancelled the direct debit. 
She provided information from her bank which indicated that the cancellation instruction had 
come from Creation itself. Although Miss M complained to Creation in early February, and 
chased up a full response she did not receive one until June, after we were involved. 
Creation said the instruction to cancel the direct debit had come from Miss M’s bank, through 
ADDACS (automated direct debit amendment and cancellation service - which allows banks 
to notify service users if changes are made to a customer’s direct debit instruction). Creation 
said it had written to her about that at the address it held: but she had not given it her latest 
address.
Our adjudicator recommended that the complaint was upheld. He said that although 
Creation acted as instructed by ADDACS, Miss M’s bank had disputed that, and there was 
no evidence of such an instruction being given. He did not think Miss M had cancelled the 
direct debit and thought the adverse information on her credit file was not a true reflection of 
the situation. He said that Creation’s communication and complaint handling had been 
unsatisfactory. He recommended that Creation allowed Miss M to make the two missing 
payments without interest or charges, reverse any adverse entries added to the credit file up 
to the first payment being missed, and paid Miss M £150 for poor complaint handling and 
lack of communication.
Creation repeated that it had followed an instruction it had received via ADDACS. It provided 
screen shots which it said showed that it received notification on 18 November 2014 via 
ADDACS that Miss M had changed her bank details: so the original direct debit instruction 
was no longer live. (However the relevant screen shot gives a date of 18 November 2013, 
not 2014, for the change of bank details.) It believed that the missed payments in December 
2014 and January 2015 reflected a true payment history. It proposed only removing records 
of missed payments from February, after Miss M had contacted it. It was prepared to offer 
£50 for the poor service.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Unfortunately it remains a mystery why and how the direct debit was cancelled. I think the 
recent information Creation sent, about a change of bank details, is irrelevant as it actually 
refers to 2013 not 2014. But Creation and Miss M’s bank have each provided a report from 
their computer systems which appear to show that the direct debit cancellation in 2014 
originated with the other organisation. But I am satisfied that, however the cancellation 
happened, it was not as a result of an instruction by Miss M. Therefore I do not think it would 
be right for her credit report to suggest that she had failed to make necessary payments, as 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7816200
--------------------------

2
that would not be a fair reflection of her management of the account. So her credit report 
should be amended to remove any adverse information on the account from November 2014 
onwards. I understand she has now settled it in full.
I do not criticise Creation for the delay in Miss M discovering the situation. I have not seen 
evidence to show that Miss M had notified Creation of her change of address before 
February 2015.
However I do not think that, when I am satisfied that Miss M did not cancel the payments, 
that it would be fair for her to have to pay any additional fees and charges caused by the 
cancellation. I understand that Miss M did not clear the account for some time after she 
discovered the situation, but for most of that time she was waiting for a response to her 
complaint. So I think any fees and charges Miss M had paid should now be refunded to her.
I agree with the adjudicator that the handling of the complaint was poor. The situation was 
not especially complex but Creation failed to provide any sort of substantive response for 
about four months. That has delayed resolution of the matter, over a period when Miss M’s 
credit record has been adversely affected. I think compensation of £150 would be 
appropriate.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint as regards the handling of matters after Miss M 
complained. In full and final settlement I order Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:
-
remove any adverse information about this account from November 2014 onwards;
-
refund to Miss M any fees and charges she incurred following the direct debit 
cancellation;
-
pay her £150 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 October 2015.

complaint
Mr F complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy to him. 
background
In 2008 Mr F bought a television in a shop and took out a loan to pay for it. At the same time 
Creation sold him a PPI policy. This was added to the loan and repaid over the loan term. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr F’s complaint, because she didn’t think Creation had made clear 
how much the policy would cost. Creation disagreed. It said the paperwork it gave Mr F 
when he bought the policy would have made him aware of the cost.  
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr F’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr F how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr F to work it out 
for himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it seems to have been on page two of 
a document setting out information about the policy. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr F 
would expect it to be. I can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he 
was in a shop and his attention was on buying a television – not on buying insurance. 
Mr F says (and I accept) that nothing was explained about the policy. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr F better understand what it was costing him. 

I don’t think Mr F would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of how 
much it was going to cost him, compared to the modest amount he was borrowing.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr F’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr F should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term. 
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr F because PPI was added to 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7865424
--------------------------

2
the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr F had taken out the loan 
without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mr F actually paid, and paying him the difference; 
and

paying Mr F simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mr F setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr F needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr F should refer back to Creation if he’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mr F and 
Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
I uphold Mr F’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation 
I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr F to accept or

complaint
Mrs H says that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold her six payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policies.
background
Mrs H took out six loans between 2005 and 2010. Creation sold Mrs H PPI polices alongside 
each of the loans. Mrs H borrowed extra to pay for the policies, which were added to the 
loans and attracted interest. The policies gave Mrs H personal accident, hospitalisation and 
life cover. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mrs H’s complaint. She thought that Creation shouldn’t have sold the 
policies to Mrs H without pointing out to her that they wouldn’t meet her needs because of 
her health problems. Creation disagreed. It said it gave Mrs H enough information about the 
policy exclusions so that she could make an informed choice.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Mrs H’s case.
I’ve decided to uphold Mrs H’s complaint.
Based on the evidence I’ve seen I don’t think Creation recommended the policies to Mrs H. 
This means it didn’t have to make sure the policies were right for her needs and 
circumstances. But it did have to give Mrs H enough clear information about the policies so 
that she could make an informed decision about whether she wanted to buy them. 
The policies didn’t cover medical conditions that a person had when they bought them. Mrs 
H had a number of health problems when she took out the policies. So I think the policies 
wouldn’t have covered the most likely reason she would’ve had to claim on them. That 
means the policies were worth a lot less to her. Creation should’ve clearly pointed this out to 
Mrs H, so she could decide if she wanted the policy or not. And I don’t think Creation did that 
well enough.
Creation hasn’t been able to give us a recording of its sales calls with Mrs H. But it has given 
us a copy of the call script that it says would’ve been used by its sales advisers when it sold 
the policies to Mrs H. So I’ve looked at this to help me reach my decision. I’ve also looked at 
the paperwork from the time of the sale, which includes Mrs H’s signed loan agreements and 
policy documents.
I can see from looking at the call script that Creation would’ve told Mrs H that the policy had 
exclusions and that ‘generally you will not be covered for anything that you knew about prior 
to taking the cover, or any circumstances which were within your control. So for example you 
will not be covered for hospitalisation or personal injury due to pre-existing medical 
conditions.’ But it doesn’t look like there would’ve been any further discussion or explanation 
about it.

According to the script Creation wouldn’t have told Mrs H that the policy didn’t provide 
hospitalisation cover where the claim related to any pre-existing medical condition (PEMC) 
unless a person had ‘been symptom free and has not consulted a doctor or received 
treatment for the condition in the 24 months prior to your claim.’ And it didn’t tell Mrs H 
benefit wouldn’t be paid for ‘any claim due to or arising from any pre-existing medical 
condition – any condition, injury, illness, disease, sickness or related condition and/or 
associated symptoms whether diagnosed or not’. So I don’t think Creation made the extent 
of this exclusion clear to Mrs H.
Creation says following its phone calls with Mrs H, it would’ve sent her a policy summary. 
And that it was Mrs H’s responsibility to review the information within the summaries to 
decide whether the policies were right for her. But Creation has also told us that a policy 
summary would’ve only been sent to Mrs H after she’d agreed to take out the policies.  
Even if I accept Mrs H did see the policy summaries, I don’t think the exclusions relating to 
PEMC’s were made clear to her. I accept that the policy summary does mention that 
PEMC’s are excluded under the policies. But this was in small closely worded text and Mrs H  
would’ve only been able to establish the exclusion by cross-referencing the definitions 
section of the policy document with that relating to the exclusions. So I think this information 
could’ve easily been missed by Mrs H.  
I don’t think this was good enough to meet her information needs. In any case, it appears 
Mrs H made her decision to take the policies out during her phone calls with Creation. So it 
was at that point her attention should’ve been drawn to the policy exclusions so that she 
could make a properly informed choice. And for the reasons I’ve explained, I don’t think 
Creation did this well enough.
I think this exclusion is something that would’ve been important to Mrs H and would’ve 
affected her decision to take out the policies. I say this because Mrs H has told us she had a 
number of health problems, which included chronic conditions, before she took out the 
policies. Mrs H’s health problems were serious, likely to worsen and could lead to other 
conditions. So I think it would’ve been difficult for Mrs H to make a claim. And I think when 
she agreed to take out the policy, given the nature of her conditions; she might’ve thought 
any future stay in hospital could well be because of her PEMC’s or something related to 
them.
In summary, if Creation had made Mrs H aware of this important aspect of the policies, 
I don’t think she’d have taken them out. This is because she’d have realised she couldn’t 
claim for her medical conditions. This means she’s lost out because of what Creation did 
wrong when it sold the policies and it should put this right
I recognise the policies also provided life and personal accident cover. But in order to benefit 
from this Mrs H would need to die or lose her sight or a limb (or lose use of a limb) because 
of an accident. So I think she might’ve thought the circumstances in which she was likely to 
benefit from these elements of the cover were limited.
what Creation should do to put things right
Subject to Mrs H agreeing to cancel any PPI policy that was mis-sold and is still in force 
Creation should:
(A) In respect of each loan:
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7885658
--------------------------


recalculate the loan and the payments to what they would have been if Mrs H had taken 
the loans without PPI;  

repay to Mrs H the amounts by which the payments actually made exceeded the 
recalculated payments;

pay Mrs H interest on each of these amounts at 8% per year simple† from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid;

recalculate the balance that would have been outstanding at the end of each loan had 
the recalculated loan not included PPI.
(B) calculate how much of the balance that was carried forward to the subsequent loan 
related to the cost of the PPI policy taken out for the previous loan; and

repay to Mrs H all amounts paid under each subsequent loan in respect of the carried 
forward balance, including interest and charges;

pay Mrs H interest on each of these amounts at 8% per year simple† from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid.
(C) where the most recent loan is still in force and it includes the cost of the most recent PPI 
policy and/or any balance carried forward from the cost of previous PPI policies, Creation 
should restructure the loan or arrange for the loan to be restructured so that the balance 
is reduced to the level that it would have been if it had not included any of the costs of 
the mis-sold PPI policies.
Set out in writing for Mrs H details of the calculations under (A), (B) and (C).  † I understand 
Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the compensation. Whether Mrs H 
needs to take any further action will depend on her financial circumstances. More information 
about the tax position can be found on our website. Mrs H should refer back to Creation if she is 
unsure of the approach it has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if 
they want to know more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation. 
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’ve decided to uphold Mrs H’s complaint and direct Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd to pay her compensation as set out in this decision. Under the rules 
of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs H to accept or reject my 
decision before 29 March 2016.

complaint
Miss C complains that a credit agreement which she entered into with Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd wasn’t explained to her properly. She says she wasn’t told that interest would be 
charged during the 12 month Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) period if she didn’t settle the loan 
within that time and that if this has been explained to her before she entered into the credit 
agreement she would have made sure that she settled within the BNPL period.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy of which is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained why I didn’t consider that there had been a 
misrepresentation and why I proposed not to uphold Miss C’s complaint. I invited Miss C and 
Creation to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to make before I 
finally determined the matter.
Miss C said she had nothing further to add. Creation didn’t reply to my provisional decision.
my findings
I’ve reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither Miss C nor Creation has made any further arguments. So I see no reason to reach 
different conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons – as well as those set out in my provisional decision – my final decision is 
that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 October 2018.

complaint
Mr P complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd made a mistake in how it administered 
his account. He says he is now out of pocket and entitled to a refund.
He also complains that the way it went about asking him to pay back money was 
inappropriate.
background
Mr P had an agreement with Creation that it would take six monthly payments from him 
starting in September 2015. But for some reason it messed up and didn’t start taking 
payments from him until December 2015. It took three monthly payments from this point.
When Mr P found out about this he thought it just wasn’t right what Creation had done 
because it wasn’t what was agreed. And further he thought Creation should’ve given him 
30 days’ notice of what it was going to do and didn’t. Creation agreed to take no further 
payments and write off the remaining balance. And then Mr P used the direct debit 
guarantee to claim back all three of the payments taken.
Creation then began chasing him for these payments. Mr P objected to this because he 
thought he owed it nothing and hadn’t done anything other than exercise his rights, under 
the agreement and the direct debit guarantee. He suggested he was within his rights to 
charge it for his time in these circumstances.
Mr P and Creation couldn’t agree a way forward so Mr P came to us.
Our adjudicator didn’t recommend upholding Mr P’s complaint.
Mr P rejected this recommendation and asked that an ombudsman review his complaint.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I’ve decided not to uphold Mr P’s 
complaint. I explain below why this is.
There’s no doubt Creation made a mistake. It should’ve collected the money on the dates 
that it had agreed with Mr P. It didn’t. The question for me is does this mistake mean that it’s 
fair and reasonable that Mr P should now not have to pay Creation anything given that he 
has the goods he used the agreement with Creation to pay for. And given he borrowed the 
money on the clear understanding that he’d pay it back. I don’t think it does.
Mr P owed Creation money. It slipped up when it collected the money later than it should’ve 
done. And really it could’ve handled the situation better. That said, Mr P always did owe 
Creation the money and I can’t see why it would be fair and reasonable for him to pay it 
nothing now.
I don’t agree that the direct debit guarantee is meant to cover situations like this one. Mr P 
had I think authorised the direct debits. He’d authorised six payments from September 2015 
and Creation took three of those six payments. Just because it took fewer payments than it 
said it would I can’t see that this means it wasn’t authorised to take the payments. Even if I’m 
Ref:

DRN7950632
--------------------------

2
wrong about this in the circumstances given that Mr P did owe the money. And, given that 
Creation has written off three months’ worth of payments already to which it was entitled, 
I think Mr P has suffered no financial loss. Rather he has ended up paying fifty per cent less 
than he’d agreed to in the first place – although I realise he sees it differently.
It follows that I think Creation has done nothing wrong in asking him to pay it back. It wasn’t 
inappropriate for it to do this just because Mr P had complained to it and us. I don’t see this 
as harassment. Neither do I think that it’s appropriate to ask Creation to pay his invoice for 
his time in dealing with this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I don’t uphold Mr P’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2016.

complaint
Mrs H complains errors by Creation Consumer Finance Ltd led to her direct debit payments 
being cancelled and arrears on her account. She wants compensation and any adverse 
markers on her credit file removing. The agreement is in Mrs H’s maiden name but for 
convenience I’ll refer to her throughout as Mrs H.
background 
Mrs H tells us she has an account with Creation and makes monthly repayments by Direct 
Debit. But she recently noticed it wasn’t collecting the direct debits. She says she now finds 
herself in arrears and late payment markers on her credit file.
Creation told us the issue arose as the customer’s bank, who I’ll call “N” cancelled the 
mandate. But it offered £50 compensation as it accepted it hadn’t always sent arrears letters 
when this occurred. And it said it would remove late payment markers from Mrs H’s credit 
file. In respect of the arrears which had accumulated it said it would be willing to make a 
payment arrangement with Mrs H - and once that was paid, it would amend the credit file to 
show clear payments.
The investigator recommended the complaint should be upheld. He felt the late payment 
markers should be removed from Mrs H’s credit file and Creation should pay her £150 in 
compensation.
Creation didn’t agree and said it would offer £50 compensation and to clear the late markers 
from the credit card. It wanted an ombudsman to make the final decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mrs H is upset about what’s happened. The credit arrangement she 
had with Creation appeared to be operating normally from December 2016 until late 2017. 
And she’d set up a direct debit arrangement from which Creation could take payments from 
her bank account with N. 
But the debits suddenly stopped being taken. And when Mrs H’s husband rang Creation to 
tell them about this it seems to have been the catalyst for a dispute to arise between 
Creation and N as to who was to blame. Unfortunately, Mrs H - the person who all agree 
was not at fault - was caught in the middle. The result was the account fell into arrears and 
late payment markers were placed on Mrs H’s credit record.
Whilst I don’t think I need go into great detail I think it’s necessary to briefly explain how 
direct debits operate. A direct debit is an authority given by a customer of a business - which 
permits that business to take payments from the customer’s bank account. So if a payment 
wasn’t made I’d expect the business to notify the customer - not the bank. As it would be the 
business which hadn’t been paid what it was due.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7962025
--------------------------

2
I’ve seen evidence that Creation cancelled the direct debit several times and then sought to 
reinstate it - at first without success. But I don’t see it as being helpful to start analysing the 
complexities of what went wrong - particularly as I understand the problem appears to have 
been overcome. And Creation have confirmed the latest direct debits have gone through
as expected. What I can say is a complaint against N - about its part over the same issue - 
was not upheld.
The consequence of this unfortunate sequence of events is that Mrs H is now in arrears and 
late payment markers have appeared on her credit file. And quite naturally Mrs H views this 
with serious concern as it can seriously impact upon her access to future credit - including 
mortgages.
I’m aware there’s a considerable difference between what the parties feel is suitable redress 
in this case. Creation has offered £50 in respect of the failure to send arrears letters. Whilst 
Mr H, on behalf of his wife, thinks £500 would be fair. 
I’m minded to think the investigator’s recommendation of £150 is fair and reasonable. The 
object of compensation is to offer some recompense to a customer - not to punish a 
business. And whilst I accept Creation’s offer has been made in good faith I think it doesn’t 
go quite far enough. It took several months to sort the issue out and the effects are still being 
experienced by Mrs H in terms of her credit file. So I think the distress and inconvenience 
she’s gone through is better reflected in the figure suggested by the investigator.
In summary, I’m going to uphold the complaint and require Creation to pay £150 to Mrs H. 
But as Mrs H is concerned about the effect on her credit file it seems to me the best way to 
minimise this is for Creation to deduct any arrears owing before paying the balance to Mrs H.
This way her credit file can be marked as clear in the shortest possible time.
my final decision
For the reasons given above my final decision is I’m upholding this complaint. I’m ordering 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:
1.
Arrange to remove late payment markers arising from this complaint from Mrs H’s 
credit file - if not already done.
2.
Pay Mrs H £150 compensation for distress and inconvenience.
3.
Arrange to remove all reference from Mrs H’s credit file to any payment arrangement 
in respect of this account arising from the arrears to which this complaint relates. This 
need only be done after all such arrears are paid.
Creation may deduct any arrears and credit Mrs H’s account before paying the balance of 
the above sum (if any) to Mrs H.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2018

complaint
Mrs M complains about an insurance policy sold to her by telephone in 2006 by 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. The policy covered a £1,099, three-year loan. It provided 
life, personal accident and hospitalisation cover. Mrs M says the policy was mis-sold. 
background
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint be upheld. She didn’t think Creation had made 
Mrs M aware the policy was optional, or made her aware of the cost of it. 
Creation disagreed, so the case has been referred to me for a decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. In doing so, I have taken into account any 
relevant regulatory rules and guidance, as well as the law and good industry practice when 
the policy was sold.
The policy Mrs M took out was not a ‘traditional’ payment protection insurance (PPI) policy; it 
didn’t provide accident, sickness and/or unemployment cover. However, I think the relevant 
considerations in this case are materially the same as our well-established approach to 
PPI complaints, which is published on our website. 
did Mrs M have a real choice about whether to buy the policy?
First and foremost, I have considered whether Creation made clear to Mrs M that the policy 
was optional – and that she could choose to buy it, or not. 
the telephone call
Creation says this policy was sold by telephone and Mrs M seems to agree with that. 
However, Creation hasn’t been able to provide a call recording. Instead it’s provided a ‘script’ 
it says would have been followed. 
The first thing I’ll say is that I have some doubts about whether the script Creation has 
provided is likely to have applied to this sale at all. I say this because:

it’s attached to the details of a loan for a completely different customer;

it’s dated around four months after Mrs M’s policy sale (and it isn’t clear whether it 
applied to earlier sales); and

it refers to cover for “death, accident, sickness or unemployment”, which is not the type 
of cover sold to Mrs M. 
However, even if I assume for the purposes of this decision that the script – or something 
very similar – was used, I’m not satisfied that Creation made the optional nature of the policy 
clear to Mrs M. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7979296
--------------------------

2
The script is short. It seems to have been described to the call handler as something that 
‘may prove useful’, rather than a script to be followed to the letter. It didn’t require the call 
handler to clearly explain that the policy was optional. And at no point did it require them to 
ask for Mrs M’s explicit consent before adding the policy to her loan. 
The opening part of the script says:
“I am now going to give you two quotations, one is with payment protection and one is 
without…”
Creation argues that giving quotes with and without payment protection would have made 
the optional nature of the policy clear to Mrs M. I don’t agree. For the reasons given above, 
I can’t know for certain what Mrs M was actually told at this point. And the script doesn’t offer 
any level of detail about precisely what form those quotes took, how they were delivered and 
also to what extent the ‘without’ quote would have been given any prominence. 
The statement about giving ‘with and without quotes’ was also immediately followed by a 
‘status disclosure’ statement; rather than the quotes themselves. So it is far from clear at 
what point in the call the quotes were actually given. I’m not satisfied that the reference to 
quotes is enough to show that the optional nature of the policy was made clear. 
I’ve also considered Mrs M’s recollection that she thought she had no choice about taking 
the policy out. When viewed in conjunction with a script which leaves me with no confidence 
that the optional nature of the policy was made explicitly, or even implicitly, clear – and 
where Mrs M’s consent to the policy was not asked for – I find Mrs M’s submissions 
plausible and persuasive. 
Similarly, I don’t find that the brief reference to statutory cancellation rights would have been 
enough to make Mrs M aware that taking the policy out was entirely her choice. Nor do 
I think it would have given her the confidence to cancel the policy where she hadn’t first been 
made aware that the policy was optional. 
the paperwork
Creation argues that the paperwork sent to Mrs M immediately after the telephone call would 
have made the optional nature of the policy clear. But again I have concerns about the 
information Creation has referred to, because:

Creation hasn’t been able to provide a copy of Mrs M’s actual, signed, credit agreement.

Creation first sent us a ’pre-contract credit information’ sheet and a reconstituted copy of 
a fixed-sum loan agreement it says Mrs M would have seen. Neither document 
mentioned the policy at all. And neither of them asked for Mrs M’s consent to add the 
policy to the loan.

After the adjudicator upheld the complaint Creation provided a sample copy of a 
different fixed-sum loan agreement it says Mrs M would have seen. It seems this would 
have given some separate information about the policy and would also have required 
Mrs M to tick a box and also sign a separate section of the credit agreement to say she 
wanted to take out the policy. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7979296
--------------------------

3
Overall Creation hasn’t provided a very clear, or consistent, account of how this sale came 
about. And, as Creation has referred to different documents in its responses, it’s hard for me 
to be sure what Mrs M saw after the telephone call. But even if I accept that she saw the 
second type of credit agreement Creation referred to, I still don’t find that this would have 
made the optional nature of the policy clear to her, because:

The credit agreement already included the policy. And it followed on from a sales call in 
which the optional nature of the policy wasn’t explained and where Creation didn’t gain 
Mrs M’s consent to have it added to the loan. 

It’s reasonable to conclude that Mrs M would place greater reliance on what she was 
told during the telephone call, than on anything she received in writing afterwards; 
because it’s during the telephone call that the policy was sold to her. So it’s during the 
telephone call that Creation should have made clear to Mrs M the optional nature of the 
policy. I find that it failed to do so. 

The credit agreement didn’t say the policy was optional, or explain what would happen if 
the loan applicant chose not to tick and sign to accept the policy. 
Again I’m not persuaded that Mrs M would have understood from the information in the 
second credit agreement (assuming she saw it), that she had a real choice about whether to 
accept the policy. 
I’ve also considered the rest of the documents Creation says Mrs M would have been 
provided with; in particular the ‘policy summary’ which contained a demands and needs 
statement and a statement of price. I note that the very last sentence on the bottom of the 
statement of price says “It is not a requirement of your credit agreement with [Creation] that 
you purchase Creditcover.” But again I don’t think this was enough to make Mrs M aware of 
the optional nature of the policy, because:

it isn’t clear whether Mrs M ever saw this document or had it adequately drawn to her 
attention, or when and how this would have been done;

(even if she saw it) it’s unlikely Mrs M would have given the policy summary (which she 
didn’t have to sign) the same degree of attention as she would have given to the credit 
agreement (which she would have had to sign); and

(as I’ve already mentioned) the above sentence was the very last piece of information 
on page two of this document – and so it wasn’t in a prominent location and could be 
easily overlooked.
For all the reasons given above, I find that Creation failed to make clear to Mrs M that she 
had any real choice about whether to buy this policy. And it has also failed to show that 
Mrs M actually consented to buy the policy. 
This is a significant and fundamental failing on Creation’s part. I therefore uphold Mrs M’s 
complaint on this basis. 
other failings
In light of my findings above it isn’t necessary for me to go any further, or to consider any 
other aspects of the way the policy was sold. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN7979296
--------------------------

But, for completeness, I will add that I also agree with the adjudicator’s finding that Creation 
failed to meet Mrs M’s information needs. Specifically, that it failed to properly disclose the 
cost of the policy to Mrs M. I say this because:

(Leaving aside for a moment the wider concerns I’ve already expressed above) the 
script didn’t require the call handler to disclose the single premium cost, the interest 
charged on that single premium, or the total cost of the policy. Mrs M also wouldn’t have 
been told that the premium would be added to her loan and that it would bear interest. 
I have no reason to doubt that this would have been important information for Mrs M. 
And it should have been disclosed to her during the call, but wasn’t.

The credit agreement was the main finance document. But neither version Creation has 
provided showed the policy interest as a separate figure. Mrs M would have had to 
deduct the policy premium from the total cost to find out what the interest cost was. 
These items were likely to have been only two of several figures on the credit 
agreement – and were themselves only part of a large amount of overall information 
Mrs M would have had to review. I’m not persuaded she would have known that she 
would have to work out the policy interest herself – particularly off the back of a 
telephone conversation where the interest-bearing nature of the premium, as well as 
other important information about the cost of the policy, wasn’t discussed at all. 

I’ve already said that I can’t be sure Mrs M would have seen the policy summary and 
statement of price, or had it adequately drawn to her attention. Yet this was the only 
document which showed the interest being charged on the policy as a separate figure. 
Nothing in the title of this document suggests it would contain important information 
about the cost of the policy. Nor does it make Mrs M aware that she should look at the 
second page of this document to find out the interest being charged on her policy 
premium. That wasn’t a prominent location. 
This was a single premium policy; paid for in a very different way to most other insurance 
products. In particular, its cost structure was different – because the initial premium cost was 
significantly increased by the interest added to it over the term of the loan. This wasn’t a 
straightforward way to fund insurance and not something Mrs M was likely to have much 
understanding of. Nor was she likely to be in a position to appreciate that single premium 
policies can often be an expensive way of paying for cover over the more familiar and 
perhaps easier to understand regular premium policy.
I’ve also considered the overall context of this sale. Mrs M was taking a relatively modest 
loan, over a fairly short term. Her monthly payments would have been £38.91 without the 
policy – which Creation says cost £7.73 per month. 
The policy would settle off the loan if Mrs M died. Or it would pay a set lump sum if she 
suffered an accidental bodily injury which led, within 12 months, to loss of sight – or to loss 
of (or loss of use of) a limb. Otherwise it offered a daily benefit (paid monthly) if Mrs M was in 
hospital for more than 5 days in a row (to a maximum of 12 months benefit per claim). The 
circumstances in which the policy would pay benefit were therefore limited. 
It was Creation’s responsibility to provide Mrs M with enough information about the main 
features and benefits of the policy to enable her to make an informed choice. Creation 
should have ensured that Mrs M’s attention was drawn to the important information about 
the policy which would be likely to affect her decision making.

DRN7979296

In this case I’ve already concluded that Mrs M didn’t make a decision – because she wasn’t 
made aware the policy was optional and Creation hasn’t been able to show that she 
consented to buy it. But, even if Creation had made Mrs M aware that she had a choice – 
and could show she made that choice – I’m not satisfied that Creation met its responsibility 
to give her enough information to make an informed choice. 
I have no reason to doubt that the cost of the policy would have been important to Mrs M. 
Given the relatively limited cover the policy offered compared to the cost of it, I’m not 
persuaded that Mrs M would have seen the policy as offering any real value to her. So I’m 
not persuaded that she would have bought it if not for Creation’s failings. 
fair redress
I find that, if Mrs M hadn’t bought the policy, she would still have gone ahead with the loan. 
Therefore she should be put back in the position she would have been in if the policy hadn’t 
been sold. The loan and the policy had a term of three years so should by now have run 
their course. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mrs M because the policy was 
added to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mrs M had taken out the 
loan without the policy;

subtracting those amounts from what Mrs M actually paid and paying her the difference; 
and 

paying Mrs M interest (simple, not compound) on each of these amounts at the rate of 
8% a year from the date each payment was made to the date the redress is paid†.
B. Write to Mrs M to set out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is required to deduct basic rate tax from this 
part of the compensation. Whether Mrs M needs to take any further action will depend on 
her financial circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our 
website. 
Mrs M should refer back to Creation Consumer Finance Ltd if she is unsure of the approach 
it has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know 
more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Mrs M compensation calculated in accordance with the instructions set out above 
under ‘fair redress’.

Complaint
Mr R’s complaint is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) rejected his claim under 
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (s.75) in respect of a mattress he acquired 
using through a fixed sum loan agreement.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I won’t repeat them again 
here. Instead I’ll focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 

Mr R raised a s. 75 complaint with Creation in regard to a mattress he acquired from a 
retailer. The mattress was acquired through a credit agreement with Creation. Based on 
the facts of this case, I accept that Mr R had an eligible claim under s. 75 as a debtor–
creditor-supplier relationship was in place and the cost of the mattress fell within the 
limits.

For a s. 75 complaint to be successful the goods must either have been misrepresented 
or there must have been a breach of contract. Mr R’s complaint is about the quality of the 
mattress. An independent inspection was carried out in February 2019, and this found 
that the mattress was faulty. Given this, I accept that there was a breach of contract as 
the mattress wasn’t of a satisfactory standard.

In cases of breach of contract there can be different remedies. Mr R has raised the 
Consumer Rights Act 2015 and his right to reject the mattress. Under these regulations 
there is a short term right to reject where the goods are found to be faulty within the first 
30 days. In this case, the issue was identified after this period and Mr R raised his 
concerns around a year after acquisition. When the fault is found outside of the short 
term right to reject period then a consumer has a right to repair or replacement. If this is 
unsuccessful then there is a final right to a price reduction or rejection. The supplier in 
this case has offered to replace the mattress and I find this is reasonable and in line with 
the regulations.

Mr R contacted Creation in January 2019, and he said it wasn’t until a number of months 
later that an offer of repair was given. Mr R feels this wasn’t a reasonable timeframe and 
he should be allowed to reject the mattress. While I understand the point made by Mr R 
(including his comments about no longer wishing to deal with Creation or to accept a 
replacement) as a replacement has been offered at no cost him, I find this a reasonable 
remedy.

There is one outstanding point regrading the inspection that was carried out in February 
2019. Mr R paid for this and, given it found the mattress was faulty, I find it fair that the 
cost of this inspection is refunded to Mr R along with interest. Mr R has provided a copy 
of the invoice and this has been provided to Creation. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8016358
--------------------------

2
My final decision
My final decision is that the offer made to replace the mattress is reasonable and if this 
decision is accepted this should take place. I also require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to 
refund Mr R the cost of the inspection report he paid for in February 2019 along with 8% 
simple interest from the date of payment to the date of settlement (invoice has been 
provided).
If Creation considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Mr R how much it’s taken off. It should also give Mr R a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2020.

complaint
Ms V complains about a single premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd sold to her in 2005 with a fixed-sum loan. The policy 
provided life, accident, sickness and unemployment cover. Ms V says she didn’t know she 
had the policy; and didn’t need, want or ask for it.
background
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint, because she didn’t think Creation had done enough to 
make Ms V aware of the cost of the policy; in particular the interest charged on it. Creation 
disagreed. It said the documents it gave to Ms V would have made her aware of the interest 
charged. And it said Ms V should have read those documents and questioned anything she 
didn’t understand.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. In doing so, I have taken into account any 
relevant regulatory rules and guidance, as well as the law and good industry practice when 
the policy was sold.
We’ve been looking at complaints about the sale of PPI for several years now. And we have 
a well-established approach, which is published on our website. I think the relevant issues in 
this case are the same as our published approach.
After considering what Creation and Ms V have said and provided I am upholding this 
complaint. I find that Creation failed to properly disclose the cost of the policy to Ms V. And 
I also find that, if she’d been aware of that information, Ms V wouldn’t have bought the 
policy. I say this because:

Ms V was in a shop buying furniture costing around £2,200. Her focus was likely to be 
on picking the furniture she wanted; not on buying insurance to cover any finance she 
was taking out to pay for it. Ms V’s description of the sale also suggests that her 
attention wasn’t drawn to the policy.

This was a single premium PPI policy – where the initial premium (£807.91) was 
significantly increased by the interest added to it over the term of the loan (£720.56). 
The interest was high in relation to the premium itself. I think this was an unusual aspect 
of this policy and not something Ms V is likely to have expected.

The credit agreement didn’t show the PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t 
reasonable to expect Ms V to work out this figure herself from the information in the 
credit agreement. That calculation would have been made more difficult for Ms V 
because she would also have had to allow for the effect of a warranty (and interest on 
that warranty) which was included in the figures shown on the agreement.

Creation has provided some evidence that it required retailers selling insurance on its 
behalf to hand customers a policy summary – which featured the statement of price and 
gave the PPI premium and interest cost as separate figures. However, I can’t be sure 
that the statement of price and the importance of the information it contained was 
adequately drawn to Ms V’s attention. The information it contained wasn’t in a prominent 
location, or where Ms V would reasonably expect to find it.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8018532
--------------------------

2

None of the documents showed the monthly cost of the policy. This information might 
have helped Ms V understand its cost in relation to what she was spending on the 
goods. As a matter of good industry practice this is information I might reasonably 
expect to see for this type of policy.

I think Ms V would have viewed the interest being charged on the PPI as important 
information in her decision about whether to buy the policy. Especially as she was 
borrowing a fairly modest amount over a fairly short term. And also in the context that 
the total cost of the PPI was well over half the base cost of the goods she was buying.

The ‘buy now pay later’ nature of the agreement also meant the whole balance (with the 
PPI premium) was accruing interest at 29.8% for the whole of the 12-month deferred 
period. This meant Ms V would pay a substantial additional amount in interest on the 
single premium PPI in the first year; when the only benefit she gained was ‘free’ life 
cover. I’m not satisfied the information in the credit agreement was enough to make 
Ms V properly aware of this; which compounds the cost disclosure failings set out 
above.
Creation says the onus was on Ms V to read the information given and ask for further 
information if she didn’t understand something. That isn’t correct. It was Creation’s 
responsibility to give Ms V enough information about the main features and benefits of the 
policy to enable her to make an informed choice. For the reasons given above I find that 
Creation failed to meet its responsibilities when it sold this policy to Ms V, as it didn’t make 
her properly aware of the cost of the policy. And I don’t think Ms V would have bought the 
policy, if not for Creation’s failing.
fair redress
I find that, if Ms V hadn’t bought the PPI, she would still have gone ahead with the loan. 
So she should be put back in the position she would have been in if the PPI hadn’t been 
sold. The loan and the PPI had a 48-month term (including the deferred period). So both 
should now have ended. However, I understand Ms V fell behind with the loan payments and 
there is still a modest balance outstanding. Ms V is paying this with reduced monthly 
payments. According to the policy terms and conditions, the PPI would have ended when the 
loan was originally supposed to end (2009).
In these circumstances Creation should:
A. Restructure the debt (without charge to Ms V) so that:

any outstanding PPI is removed; and

any arrears on the account that are attributable to the PPI (including any interest and 
charges) are removed.
B. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Ms V because PPI was added 
to her loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Ms V had taken out the 
loan without PPI;
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8018532
--------------------------

3

subtracting those amounts from what Ms V actually paid and paying her the 
difference;

paying Ms V interest (simple not compound) on each of these amounts at the rate of 
8% a year from the date each payment was made to the date the redress is paid(†); 
and

taking into account any PPI refunded to Ms V (if the policy was cancelled early) 
and/or the value of any successful claim (if one has previously been made).
C. Write to Ms V to set out what she still owes and how much she will pay and when as a 
result of (A). This should include the details of the calculations and amounts under (B).
If Ms V wants to use any money she receives to reduce the debt, Creation should let her. 
But it can’t make Ms V reduce the debt to less than it would now be if she hadn’t bought the 
policy.
† I understand Creation has to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the compensation. 
Whether Ms V needs to take any further action will depend on her financial circumstances. 
The parties can find more information about the tax position on our website. Ms V should 
refer back to Creation if she’s unsure of the approach it has taken and both parties should 
contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax treatment of this 
portion of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Ms V compensation calculated as set out in the instructions under ‘fair redress’.

Complaint
Mr K’s complaint is about the sofa he financed through a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. He says it wasn’t as described. 
Background

M K entered into a loan agreement to buy a sofa in May 2018. He raised a claim under 
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (S. 75) because he said the sofa wasn’t as 
described.

Mr K said that he chose to buy the sofa because it was advertised as having a hardwood 
frame and he intended to keep the sofa for a long time, reupholstering as necessary, and 
so wanted a hardwood frame for its durability. He said that when he was buying the sofa 
he checked with the sales agent that the frame was hardwood and this was confirmed. 

After a few months Mr K was concerned that the sofa’s frame wasn’t made of hardwood. 
He had an independent inspection carried out in April 2019. He said he asked for the 
inspector to confirm if the frame was made of hardwood. The inspection noted that 
certain parts were made of softwood and didn’t note any hardwood. Given this Mr K said 
the sofa wasn’t as described. He contacted the retailer and then raised a s.75 claim.  

Creation said that it contacted the retailer and it had confirmed that the frame was made 
from hardwood as had been described.

Mr K didn’t agree and brought his complaint to us.

After investigating, our investigator concluded the complaint should not be upheld.

Mr K doesn’t agree.
I’ll now set out my decision and the reasons for it. 
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I’ve decided this 
complaint should not be upheld for these reasons: 

Mr K made a s. 75 claim. S 75 allows, in certain circumstances, the borrower under a 
credit agreement to claim against the credit provider if there’s a breach of contract, or 
misrepresentation by the supplier of goods or services. Mr K said the sofa wasn’t as 
described. Therefore for me to uphold this complaint I would need to be satisfied that 
the goods had been misrepresented or there had been a breach of contract. 

The sofa Mr K bought was advertised as having a hardwood frame and he has said 
that he confirmed this with the sales adviser. Mr K has said that the hardwood frame 
was important to him and that he wouldn’t have bought the sofa had he not thought 
the frame was hardwood. Based on the evidence I accept the sofa was advertised as 
having a hardwood frame and, given Mr K’s comments, I accept that this was an 
important feature that induced him into purchasing the sofa. Therefore, if the frame 
wasn’t made of hardwood, I would accept that a misrepresentation had occurred.

However, the retailer has confirmed that the frame is made of hardwood. It notes 
different types of wood are used elsewhere in the sofa to allow for greater flexibility 
but that ‘all load bearing sections are always made from hardwood so the most used 
areas are built with the strongest materials’. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8026478
--------------------------

2

Mr K had an independent inspection carried out. The inspection report didn’t state if 
the frame was hardwood but did note that the ‘spring rolls and all the stress points 
are made out of a softwood apart form the arms and caster block areas seem to be a 
composite of plywood and oriented strand board blocks’. 

While the inspection report doesn’t state what the frame is made off, I can 
understand why the outcome caused Mr K concern. Our investigator contacted the 
inspection company to get further information. It said that the furniture was well 
constructed and hardwood would be used in the key stress areas of the frame for 
strength and durability with other materials used elsewhere. It said that based on the 
photographs the other materials looked of good quality and durable.

Because the evidence provided in this complaint supports hardwood being used for 
the frame, I cannot say this has been misrepresented. The evidence provided 
suggests the sofa is of satisfactory quality and I have no evidence to suggest there 
has been any breach of contract. Because of this, I do not find that Creation did 
anything wrong by not upholding Mr K’s s.75 claim. 
For the reasons set out above, I do not find that I have enough evidence to uphold this 
complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Creation Consumer Finance 
Ltd. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 July 2020.

complaint
Mr R says Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold him payment protection 
insurance (PPI) when he took out a loan in 2005.
background
In 2005, Mr R bought some furniture in a shop. He took out a loan to pay for them over three 
years. At the same time, Creation sold him a PPI policy – the cost of this was added to the 
loan.
The loan had a 12 month ‘buy now pay later’ option which meant that Mr R could pay off the 
loan, plus a small admin fee, in the first 12 months to avoid paying interest or paying for the 
PPI. Otherwise he’d pay interest on the loan, including interest charged on the PPI, over the 
remaining 36 month term. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr R’s complaint, because he didn’t think Creation had properly told 
Mr R how much the policy would cost. Creation didn’t agree so the complaint’s been passed 
to me for a decision..
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We’ve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and I’ve taken this into account in deciding 
Mr R’s case.
Having done so, I’ve decided to uphold Mr R’s complaint because I agree with the 
adjudicator – I don’t think Creation gave Mr R enough information about how much the policy 
cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr R to work it out for 
himself. All the important information about the cost of the policy should’ve been in the 
loan agreement.

The statement of price did give a separate figure for the interest – but this was on the 
second page of the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr R would expect it 
to be. I also can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention; particularly when he was in a 
shop and his attention was on buying furniture, not on buying insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr R better understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement also wasn’t enough to make Mr R aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay 
the loan off during the first 12 months the whole loan, including the PPI cost, attracted 
interest at nearly 30%. This meant he’d pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the 
PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover. 

The PPI interest shown in the statement of price was almost as much as the single 
premium for the policy. And the total policy cost was also high compared to the amount 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8030619
--------------------------

2
Mr R was borrowing to buy the furniture. This was unusual – and I think Mr R would have 
seen this as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. Especially 
as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items and his monthly 
payments (including the PPI) were less than £90.

Creation says Mr R could have cancelled the policy after signing – but he was entitled to 
be told the important information he needed to know before he signed. I don’t think the 
fact Mr R didn’t cancel the policy afterwards means he was happy with it. Or that he 
understood what it was really costing him.
Given his circumstances, I don’t think Mr R would’ve bought the policy if Creation had done 
everything it should have done during the sale. So I uphold this complaint. 
what Creation should do to put things right
I understand the loan and PPI have now ended. But Mr R borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, 
so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he paid more than he should have each 
month. Mr R now needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So Creation should:

work out and pay Mr R the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

add simple interest to the extra amount Mr R paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.
If Mr R made a successful claim under the PPI policy Creation can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off, if he asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and so Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to 
pay Mr R the compensation I’ve described.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2016.

complaint
Mr F complains Creation Consumer Finance Ltd collected a direct debit from his bank 
account when it shouldn’t have done.
background
In early September 2017 Creation collected a direct debit of £99.06 from Mr F’s bank 
account in respect of a finance agreement. It shouldn’t have done so because Mr F had 
cancelled the agreement in late August 2017.
Creation accepted the direct debit shouldn’t have been collected. It returned the sum of 
£99.06 to Mr F’s bank account in early October 2017 and offered Mr F £30 by way of an 
apology.
Mr F’s complaint was considered by one of our investigators. He concluded that Creation’s 
offer of £30 compensation was, in all the circumstances, appropriate.
Mr F didn’t agree and so the complaint has been passed to me for review and decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to point out that our role isn’t to punish Creation for its error here, but to 
compensate Mr F for the effect of that error on him. And although I don’t underestimate 
Mr F’s strength of feeling in this matter, I’m satisfied that given he hasn’t said he has 
suffered any direct financial loss (for example bank charges), how quickly an explanation for 
the error was provided and the amount and length of correspondence passed between the 
parties I’m satisfied that £30 represents a fair sum for Creation to have to pay. 
my final decision
My final decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay Mr F, to the extent it 
hasn’t already done so, £30.
I appreciate Mr F will be disappointed by my conclusions. My final decision, however, 
represents the last stage of this service’s dispute resolution procedure. Mr F doesn’t have to 
accept my decision and if he doesn’t do so, he will be free to pursue legal action against 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2018..

complaint
Mr L has complained that when he raised a concern about his loan agreement with Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd, it did not address it as quickly as it should have done.
background
Mr L took out a loan with Creation. When the first repayment was debited from his account he 
did not recognise it, so contacted Creation to say he thought he may have been a victim of a 
fraud. He says that Creation did not send him a copy of the loan agreement in a timely manner, 
and that had it done so, the matter would have been resolved quickly. The account has also 
been passed to a debt collector, but it has been put out hold pending my final decision.
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld, as she felt Creation had not 
done enough to assist Mr L. She recommended that Creation take the account back from the 
debt collector and pay Mr L £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Creation disagreed, saying it was Mr L’s responsibility to recognise transactions on his account.
The complaint has therefore been passed to me for my final decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I accept that ideally Mr L would have recognised the direct debit, as he did not, I can 
see no reason why, as its customer, Creation should not have assisted him. This would not 
have been at all onerous and would have constituted what I consider to be appropriate 
customer service. If a customer has a query about a debit, I think it perfectly reasonable to 
expect a business to clarify the issue. All that would have been required would have been to 
send Mr L a copy of the agreement. Instead, the account was passed to a collection agency, 
causing some distress and inconvenience.
On this basis, I agree with the adjudicator that Creation should take the account back from the 
debt collector and pay Mr L £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused. Further, if interest 
has been applied because of any arrears, this should be removed. However, Creation is entitled 
to require payment of the arrears, as this is money that Mr L owes.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, it is my final decision to uphold this complaint. I require Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd to:
a) take the account back from the debt collection agency;
b) remove any interest that may have been charged on any arrears; and
c)
pay Mr L £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2015.

September 2008 he did buy a regular premium PPI policy. It seems he took it out by post.
Our adjudicator did not uphold Mr T’s complaint. Mr T disagreed and so the complaint has

my provisional findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and

I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the

The policy says Mr T needed to be in paid work of at least 16 hours a week to be eligible for 
the cover. From what I’ve seen, I don’t think he was. 
Mr T has recently told us he was unemployed when he took out the PPI. He’s sent us copies 
of the following documents:

a record showing he was looking for work between the middle of August 2008 and 
the beginning of October 2008. The last entry says Mr T has been offered a self-
employed job

a P45 showing he stopped claiming jobseeker’s allowance by the middle of October 
2008

a certificate of incorporation for a limited company from October 2008. I understand 
Mr T was going to do his self-employed work through this company.
Based on this, I think Mr T was unemployed when he took out the policy and so wasn’t 
eligible for the cover. 
I don’t think Creation recommended the policy to Mr T, so it didn’t need to make sure it was 
suitable for him. But it still needed to give Mr T clear enough information for him to decide if it 
was right for him.
The main document I’ve got from the time of the sale is a copy of a Payment Plus 
Acceptance Form. At the bottom of the form, there’s a direct debit which Mr T has signed 
and dated. 
None of the terms of the policy are set out on the form. There is a statement saying the 
applicant has read and understood a policy summary. Also that the applicant is in full

time/self-employment for at least 16 hours a week and isn’t aware of any pending 
unemployment. I don’t know whether Mr T read these statements. I don’t think they’re 
prominent. And there’s no mention of why they’re important. Also, I don’t know whether Mr T 
actually received the policy summary and, if he did, whether he read and understood it. 
So I don’t think Creation made it clear to Mr T that he wouldn’t be eligible for the policy if he 
was unemployed. And I don’t think he would have bought the policy if he’d known he’d never 
be able to benefit from it. 
I think Mr T has lost out because of what Creation did wrong. And so I propose that Creation 
should put things right. 
my proposed fair compensation
I understand the loan and the PPI policy have now run their course. Creation should 
therefore:

pay back to Mr T the full value of the premiums paid for the PPI from the date it started to 
the date it ended 

add interest calculated at 8% simple per year† on the value of each premium from the 
date it was paid to the date compensation is paid 

take into account the value of any successful claim

write to Mr T to set out the details of the calculations and amounts paid to him.
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr T needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr T should refer back to Creation if he is unsure of the approach it has taken and both 
parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this portion of the compensation. 
my provisional decision
I intend to uphold Mr T’s complaint and direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to pay fair 
compensation in line with the calculation I’ve set out above.

complaint
Miss W complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy to her.
background
In 2007 Miss W bought a TV and surround sound in a shop and she took out a £1,797.94 
loan to pay for it. At the same time Creation sold her a PPI policy. The policy cost £733.70, 
which was added to the loan.
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Miss W wouldn’t pay interest if she 
paid off the credit before that date. Otherwise she’d pay interest (including £699.29 of 
interest on the policy) over the remaining 48 months of the loan.
Our adjudicator upheld Miss W’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And she didn’t think Miss W would have bought the policy if 
it had done so.
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Miss W was given 
would have made her aware of what the policy cost.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Miss J’s case.
I’ve decided to uphold Miss W’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell her how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the credit 
agreement didn’t show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to 
expect Miss W to work out the interest herself. She was entitled to expect all the 
important information about the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was at the end of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Miss W would expect it to be. And I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to her attention, particularly when she was in a shop and her attention 
was on buying a TV – not on buying insurance.

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Miss W to understand what the policy was costing her.

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Miss W aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If she didn’t pay 
the loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted 
interest at 32.4%. This meant Miss W would pay a substantial extra amount of interest 
on the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit she gained was ‘free’ life cover.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8190320
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Miss W was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Miss W would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as she was borrowing quite a modest amount.

I don’t think Miss W would have bought the policy if she‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost her.
For these reasons, I uphold Miss W’s complaint.
fair compensation
Miss W borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so her loan was bigger than it should’ve been and 
she paid more than she should’ve each month. So Miss W needs to get back the extra she’s 
paid.
So, Creation should:

Work out and pay Miss W the difference between what she paid each month on the loan 
and what she would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Miss W paid each month from when she paid it 
until she gets it back. The rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year 
from then on†.

If Miss W made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what she 
got for the claim from the amount it owes her.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Miss W a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Miss W’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay her the 
compensation I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2015.

complaint
Mr M complains that the car he bought, using a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd, was not fit for purpose or of satisfactory quality. The complaint is 
brought on his behalf by a third party.
background 
During the three month warranty period, there were some problems with the car which were 
repaired at no cost to Mr M, under the terms of the warranty. Around a year after purchase, 
the car’s engine failed and it has not been drivable since. Mr M says that since he bought the 
car he has found out the “one previous owner” was a hire car company and that it would 
seem the car had been driven more than 5,000 miles by the dealer before it was sold to him.
The adjudicator did not think there was any discrepancy in the mileage, that there was not 
enough evidence to suggest that the car had been misrepresented as a one owner car and 
that, bearing in mind the mileage the car covered since Mr M bought it, it would appear to 
have been fit for purpose at the point of sale. She thought Creation Consumer Finance 
should have handled Mr M’s complaint better than it did, and that it should pay him 
compensation of £100.
Mr M responded to say, in summary, that:

There is a mileage discrepancy and this indicates the car had more than one owner.

The dealer did not respond to him when the car needed repair, so he had to take it to a 
third party garage and pay the costs himself.

A modern car should last more than 10 years. He paid more than £13,000 for the car 
and a year later it only has scrap value – there must have been something wrong at the 
point of sale.

The car was drivable for a year after sale because of the repairs he carried out at his 
own cost.

The offer of £100 is derisory.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
mileage
When the car was serviced in October 2011, its mileage was recorded as 57,800. When the 
car was sold to Mr M, the sales invoice records the mileage as 58,000. When the MOT was 
carried out, two days later, it records the mileage as 62,544. Mr M says the dealership must 
have owned the car in 2011 when it serviced it and that it has driven it over 5,000 miles, or 
there was a second owner that has not been recorded. I accept this is possible, but I 
consider it more likely than not that the dealer noted the mileage from the last service when 
he completed the sales invoice, rather than checking the car itself. I cannot conclude that the 
mileage discrepancy points to the car having two previous owners and for this reason I do 
not think the car was misrepresented as a one owner car at the point of sale.

--------------------------
DRN8215643
--------------------------

2
repairs
Mr M says he had to arrange his own repairs – two new tyres and new shock absorbers – 
because the dealer did not respond to his calls. But this was after the warranty period had 
expired and it seems to me that the repairs needed were due to normal wear and tear, rather 
than anything that was present at the point of sale. It is unfortunate that the dealer appears 
to have provided a poor level of service – but I don’t think Creation Consumer Finance is 
obliged to refund him the cost of these repairs.
fit for purpose
I am not unsympathetic to the disappointing position in which Mr M finds himself. But I 
cannot conclude that the car was not fit for purpose when it was sold. The car was driven for 
more than the average mileage in the year since it was sold – which does not suggest to me 
that it was of unsatisfactory quality when it was sold. I accept it needed some repairs during 
that year, but these seem to be due to normal wear and tear of a vehicle of that age and 
mileage, rather than due to any fault at the point of sale.
complaint handling
Creation Consumer Finance did not give the level of service it should have done when Mr M 
complained and, in particular, it took more than six months to send Mr M its final response 
letter – and this was only after our involvement. I think Mr M should be compensated for the 
poor service he received. But, after careful consideration, I agree with the adjudicator that 
£100 is fair and reasonable.
my final decision
My decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should pay Mr M £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2015.

complaint
Miss D complains about a single premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) sold her in 2007 over the telephone. 
background
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. They didn’t think Creation had made Miss D aware 
she had a choice about whether to buy the policy. And they didn’t think it made the policy  
cost clear.
Creation disagreed. It said it gave Miss D a choice whether to buy the policy. And that the 
overall cost of the policy was clear enough.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints. 
Miss D has said she was not told the insurance was optional and that she thought it was 
essential. Creation hasn’t been able to provide a recording of the sales call. But it has 
provided a script it says would have been followed. I’m not satisfied that Creation made Miss 
D aware the policy was optional – and that she could choose to buy it, or not – because: 

The script is short. It didn’t require the call handler to clearly explain that the policy was 
optional, or get Miss D’s explicit consent to add it to her loan. 

The script told the call handler to ‘include quotes with payment protection and without’. 
But it didn’t say what form those quotes should take, how they should be delivered, or 
what prominence should be given to the ‘without’ quote. So this part of the script seems 
to have been open to interpretation by each call handler and I can’t be sure Miss D was 
given an option to accept or decline the insurance. 

I don’t think the brief mention of cancellation rights in the script was enough to make 
Miss D aware she had a choice about whether to buy the policy. And I also don’t think it 
would have given her the confidence to cancel the policy where she hadn’t first been told 
it was optional. 

Although the credit agreement does allow for Miss D to select the insurance, the policy is 
not described as optional. And this would have been sent out after the initial phone call, 
when the insurance was sold to her. 

Creation effectively sold the policy to Miss D over the phone. I think Miss D would have 
relied more on what she was told during the call than on anything she received in writing 
afterwards. So Creation should have made the optional nature of the policy clear to Miss 
D during the telephone call. However, it didn’t do that.   
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8217740
--------------------------

2
For all the reasons given above, I find that Creation failed to make clear to Miss D that she 
had any real choice about whether to buy this policy. This is a significant and fundamental 
failing on Creation’s part and I uphold Miss D’s complaint for this reason. 
Given the above, I don’t need to go on to look at any further aspects of the way the policy 
was sold. However, for clarity, I will add that I agree with the adjudicator that Creation also 
didn’t properly disclose the cost of the policy to Miss D at the point of sale. 
For these reasons, I uphold Miss D’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Miss D should be put back in the position she would now be in if she’d taken out the loan 
without the PPI policy. 
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Miss D because PPI was added 
to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Miss D had taken out the 
loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Miss D actually paid, and paying her the difference; 
and

paying Miss D simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Miss D setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Miss D needs to take any further action will depend on her financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Miss D should refer back to Creation if she’s unsure of the approach it has taken. Miss D 
and Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the 
tax treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
I uphold Miss D’s complaint. Creation Financial Services Limited must pay her the 
compensation I’ve described above.

Mr L complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold him a payment protection

In May 2005 Mr L bought some furniture in a shop and he took out a £699 loan to pay for it.

K821x#14
complaint
Mr D complains that a sofa, which was financed by a loan from Creation Consumer Finance
Limited, trading as Creation, was misrepresented to him.
background
Mr D bought a sofa in November 2013 with finance provided by a fixed sum loan agreement
with Creation. Mr D said that the sofa was misrepresented to him by the supplier of the sofa,
K. He said that K’s salesman, Mr B, told him that the Bluetooth receiver in the sofa would
work with other Bluetooth devices and that it would connect to any Smart TV. In reliance on
this statement, Mr D bought the sofa. And, before delivery of the sofa, he also bought a
Smart TV in December 2013 from another retailer as he was attracted by the TV playing
through the sofa. But, when the sofa was delivered in February 2014, it did not connect to
the Smart TV. Mr D has since discovered that even though the Smart TV had Bluetooth
capability, it was not compatible with the Bluetooth device in the sofa. This was contrary to
what Mr B had led Mr D to believe.
our adjudicator’s view
The adjudicator concluded that that there was sufficient information to suggest that Mr D was
informed that the sofa would be compatible with any Bluetooth device, which was not true.
He recommended that Creation should:-
- Cancel the agreement and take collection of the sofa;
- Refund 25% of the monthly payments; and
- Pay Mr D £100 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.
Creation disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that it was incorrect to say that the
sofa was not fit for purpose as at the time of the purchase of the sofa, Mr D did not have the
Smart TV. It said that it was Mr D’s fault that he had bought the wrong TV.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr D 
and to Creation on 21 May 2015. I summarise my findings:
 As the evidence was incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory, I reached my decision on 
the balance of probabilities – in other words, what I considered was most likely to have 
happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
Mr D’s complaint was brought against Creation under section 75 of the Consumer Credit
Act 1974 (“CCA”). The general effect of section 75 is that if Mr D has a claim for
misrepresentation against K, he can also bring that claim against Creation. To be able to
uphold that the sofa was misrepresented to Mr D, I would need to be able to conclude not
only that Mr D was given incorrect information, but also that he was induced into buying the
sofa and entering into the loan agreement because of that information.
It was not possible to be sure what was discussed between Mr B and Mr D before Mr D 
bought the sofa. Mr D had said that he was told by Mr B that the sofa had a built-in Bluetooth 
device which would connect to any Smart TV. I could see that Mr D was attracted by this 
idea, and so he bought the sofa and also decided to buy a Smart TV to take advantage of 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8319276
--------------------------

2
the Bluetooth technology within the sofa. He bought the TV in December 2013 before the 
sofa was delivered to him in February 2014. I noted that Mr D contacted K when he 
discovered that the sofa did not connect with the Smart TV. Mr D said that he was again told 
that the sofa should link up with Bluetooth systems.
I had seen a copy of Mr B’s statement. It said that Mr B could confirm that the sofa would
work with any compatible Bluetooth transmitter. Mr B also said that any device with a
Bluetooth transmitter would work with the sofa as the sofa unit was a Bluetooth receiver.
Creation had provided this service with a link to the manufacturer’s manual for Mr D’s
Smart TV. I could see that this did refer to the TV having a Bluetooth function although its
manufacturer had since said that the TV would not connect to every Bluetooth device. It is
unfortunate that Mr B did not provide Mr D with the same caveat.
In view of Mr B’s statement which confirmed his belief that the sofa would work with “any
device with a Bluetooth transmitter”, on balance, I considered that it was more likely than not 
that he would have said this to Mr D when selling the sofa. I also noted that Mr B had a 
Smart TV which was able to connect to a Bluetooth transmitter. So, I considered that it was 
also possible that Mr B would have told Mr D that the sofa could connect to any Smart TV.
As I found Mr D’s evidence and subsequent behaviour to be credible, I accepted that
Mr D relied on Mr B’s statements, and that they induced him into buying both the sofa and
the Smart TV. 
I also considered that Mr D would have checked to ensure that he bought a compatible TV if 
he had been told by K that not all Smart TVs could connect to the Bluetooth within the sofa. 
This meant that, on balance, I was satisfied that the sofa was misrepresented to Mr D and it 
was fair that Creation was held liable for this.
Mr D had explained in correspondence that his whole room had been designed and the
furniture in it had been bought to fit around the sofa. Mr D did not refer to any problems
with the sofa other than the lack of connection with the TV. So, I did not agree with the
adjudicator’s recommendations that the sofa should be collected, and the agreement
cancelled.
As Mr D was most concerned about the connection of the TV to the sofa, I wondered 
whether he had explored the use of a Bluetooth dongle/transmitter. I understood that this 
could make a TV, or other device, Bluetooth compatible. And I considered that it was 
possible that a Bluetooth transmitter, which was compatible with the sofa, could be 
purchased. This would be a swift solution to the problem if the right dongle/transmitter could 
be found. If Mr D was able to buy this, I said that the cost of it should be reimbursed by 
Creation.
If such a dongle/transmitter was not available, I proposed that Mr D’s Smart TV be collected 
by Creation at its cost, and that it refunded Mr D the amount of £1,079 which he had paid for 
his Smart TV. I considered that it would be reasonable for Creation to pay this amount to 
Mr D to enable him to buy a compatible Smart TV.
I also noted that Mr D believed that K should have done more to assist him with this issue. 
But, I could not require Creation to compensate Mr D for the trouble and upset caused by K’s
failings, as this service does not generally award such compensation for claims brought
under section 75 of the CCA.

--------------------------
DRN8319276
--------------------------

3
For the reasons I had explained, but subject to any further information or evidence I might
receive from the parties, my provisional decision was that I am minded to uphold this 
complaint in part. In full and final settlement of it, I intended to order Creation Consumer 
Finance Limited, trading as Creation, to refund Mr D the cost of a Bluetooth 
dongle/transmitter which was capable of making the Smart TV compatible with the sofa. The 
refund should be made after Creation had had sight of Mr D’s receipt for the purchased item. 
If such an item was not available, Creation should collect Mr D’s Smart TV at its cost and 
pay him £1,079 as a refund for that TV.
Creation responded to say that it agreed to cover the cost of a Bluetooth transmitter up to 
the value of £100.
Mr D disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that:-
1.
The supplier, K, was to blame as it had mis-sold the sofa, and he wanted to know 
why I had not ordered K to pay him compensation;
2.
He was unable to locate a dongle/transmitter which would connect the TV to the sofa;
3.
The TV fitted in his room and he had also spent more money buying a special stand 
for the TV to hide its wires; 
4.
He had suffered inconvenience for 16 months and he was paying insurance for an 
item he could not use; and
5.
He would like to reject the sofa.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that Creation has agreed to cover the cost of the Bluetooth transmitter. But Mr D has 
spoken to the manufacturer for his TV, and it said that no Bluetooth transmitter will work with 
the TV. 
So, as I anticipated in my provisional decision that such a transmitter might not be available, 
I consider that it would be reasonable for Creation to collect Mr D’s Smart TV at its cost and 
pay him £1,079 as a refund for that TV, to enable him to then buy a compatible Smart TV. I 
note that K said that there are Smart TVs which will work with Mr D’s sofa. In order that Mr D 
does not have a problem with compatibility again, I suggest that he takes details of his sofa 
unit to a television retailer, so that the retailer can advise him which televisions will be 
compatible.
Mr D is unhappy that I haven’t ordered compensation. But as Mr D complained to Creation 
who then issued its final response to him, this complaint has been processed against 
Creation. I can’t require Creation to pay compensation under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act.
I note that Mr D would like a refund for the stand which he bought for the TV at a cost of 
£217.49. But, I note that the stand wasn’t specially made for the TV which Mr D bought, and 
that it can be used for other TVs up to 60 inches wide. I consider it is more likely than not 
that Mr D will be able to use the stand with a replacement TV. So, I’m not persuaded that a 
refund should be ordered for it.

Mr D would also like a refund for part of the five year warranty which he has paid for his 
whole suite for a five year period to cover it against accidental damage to the leather and 
structural defects. Mr D said that he wasn’t able to use the unit, so he shouldn’t have to pay 
for the insurance for this. But I note that the unit includes spaces to hold drinks, and on 
balance, I consider it’s likely that these would have been used. So, in these circumstances, I 
don’t consider that a refund would be reasonable.
Mr D has again said that he would like to reject the sofa, but for the reasons set out above, I 
do not consider that this would be appropriate. 
I appreciate that this is not the outcome which Mr D wants. But he does not have to accept 
my decision and may pursue his case by alternative means should he wish to do so.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of it, I order 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited, trading as Creation, to collect Mr D’s Smart TV at its 
cost, and pay him £1,079 as a refund for that TV.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 August 2015.

complaint
Mr Z complains that a sofa that was supplied to him under a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited was not of satisfactory quality.
background
A sofa was supplied to Mr Z in April 2011 under a fixed sum loan agreement dated 
February 2011. Mr Z complained to the supplier that the cushions had become flat. The 
supplier inspected the sofa but found no manufacturing fault. Mr Z complained to 
Creation Consumer Finance, which arranged for the supplier to make a further inspection of 
the sofa, but was not satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
The adjudicator recommended that this complaint should be upheld. She concluded that 
Creation Consumer Finance had agreed to pay for an independent inspection of the sofa 
and the inspection report identified that the cushions were not properly filled and that they 
were too loose. She recommended that Creation Consumer Finance should replace the 
sofa, refund the £25 cost of the report, with interest, to Mr Z and that it should pay him £75 to 
compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he has been caused. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The independent report says that the sofa cushions have not been filled for their proper 
function and that the cushions are too loose. I therefore consider it to be more likely than not 
that the sofa was not of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr Z. Mr Z has been 
caused distress and inconvenience which would have been reduced if Creation Consumer 
Finance had originally instructed an independent expert (rather then the supplier) to inspect 
the sofa. As such, I agree with the adjudicator’s recommendations that the sofa should be 
replaced, that Creation Consumer Finance should refund the cost of the report, with interest, 
to Mr Z and that it should pay him £75 compensation for his distress and inconvenience. 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Z‘s complaint. In full and final settlement 
of it, I order Creation Consumer Finance Limited to:
1.
Arrange collection of Mr Z’s sofa at no cost to him.
2.
Replace the sofa with a new sofa on a like-for-like basis (or, if that is not possible, 
with a sofa that is as close as reasonably possible to Mr Z’s existing sofa after 
discussion and agreement with Mr Z).
3.
Refund to Mr Z the £25 cost of the inspection report.
4.
Pay interest on the amount at 3. above at an annual rate of 8% simple from the date 
of payment to the date of settlement.
5.
Pay £75 to Mr Z to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he has 
been caused.

If Creation Consumer Finance considers that it has to deduct tax from the interest element of 
my award, it should send Mr Z a tax deduction certificate when making payment. He can 
then use the certificate to reclaim the tax if he is entitled to do so.

complaint
Mr F complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) mis-sold his loan 
payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Mr F took out the PPI policy with a loan when he bought some furniture in December 2005. 
The sale took place in the store, and Mr F said he was advised to take the cover. Creation 
said that it didn’t offer advice to Mr F. He borrowed £2,198 for the furniture, and the PPI cost 
an additional £795.18. This was a single premium PPI policy, so the cost was added to the 
loan.
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. So if Mr F repaid the loan within that 
time he wouldn’t pay interest. After that, the loan was set to be repaid over 36 months, with 
the payments including the PPI premium and a further £709.20 in interest on the premium. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr F’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And she didn’t think Mr F would have bought the policy if it 
had.
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr F was given would 
have made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr F’s complaint. This is because I agree with the adjudicator that 
Creation didn’t properly tell Mr F how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr F to work it out 
for himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

There was a ‘statement of price’ which did set out the interest. But it was on page two of 
the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr F would expect it to be. And I 
can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a store and his 
attention was on buying furniture – not insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr F better understand what the policy was costing him. 

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr F aware of the effect 
the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t repay the 
loan within the first 12 months, the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest at 
29.8%. This meant Mr F would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI cost 
for the first year, when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8325371
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr F was borrowing. This was unusual and I think Mr 
F would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. 
Especially as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items. 

Overall I don’t think Mr F would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware 
of how much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr F’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr F should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term. So Creation 
should:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr F because PPI was added to 
the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr F had taken out the 
loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mr F actually paid, and paying him the 
difference; and

paying Mr F simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date 
each payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mr F setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr F needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr F should refer back to Creation if he’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mr F and 
Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’ve decided to uphold Mr F’s complaint. Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2014.

complaint
Mr P acquired household goods by means of a finance agreement with Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd. Mr P’s circumstances then changed, he experienced financial difficulties, and 
he agreed a reduced payment plan with Creation.
Mr P complains that three payments he made under this plan did not reach his Creation 
account. He also complains that the time taken by Creation to find these payments was 
excessive and unacceptable. In order to resolve this complaint, he wants Creation to write 
off the outstanding balance of his account.
background 
Mr P complained to Creation in the second half of April 2015. Creation was unable to provide 
a final response to him within the required period (in the second half of June), but replied 
toward the end of July. 
Creation accepted that Mr P had made the payments to it, but said that they had been lost 
because Mr P had not used his agreement number as the reference for them. Instead, he 
had used as payment reference a brief description of the acquired goods. It apologised for 
any stress and inconvenience caused by phone calls and letters from it chasing up these 
payments, but said that the problem arose because Mr P had used the wrong reference. On 
that basis, it did not uphold this part of his complaint.
 
Creation also accepted that it had found the missing payments within three weeks of 
receiving Mr P’s complaint, but took a further 11 weeks to send him its final response. It 
agreed that it had handled his complaint poorly, and offered him £50 in compensation. Mr P 
did not think this was a fair or sufficient offer.
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in part. He agreed with Creation 
about the wrong reference. But he noted that it had added charges of £55 to Mr P’s account, 
because the payments had not reached his account by the due date, even thought they had 
been made at the appropriate time. 
Our adjudicator did not consider that this was reasonable. He asked Creation to remove 
these charges, which it agreed to do.
Our adjudicator felt that compensation of £50, plus removal of these charges, represented a 
fair offer, which he recommended to Mr P. Mr P disagreed, and asked for his complaint to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I find that I have come to the same 
conclusion as our adjudicator, for the same reasons.
I agree that Creation should not be held responsible for the payments being ‘lost’. It wrote to 
Mr P in 2014, telling him to use his agreement number as the reference for his payments. 
When Mr P notified Creation that the payments were missing, it ‘found’ them within three 
weeks.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8331149
--------------------------

2
I also agree that Creation handled Mr P’s complaint poorly, which caused him further stress 
and inconvenience. But Mr P wants Creation to compensate him by writing off the 
outstanding balance of his account (just under £1,200). I think that a settlement along these 
lines would be disproportionate and inappropriate.
There is a technical note about trouble and upset on our public website, in which we 
describe:

how we decide whether to award compensation for distress, inconvenience, damage 
to reputation, pain and suffering

how we decide what to award, where compensation is appropriate

cases where we have awarded compensation
I feel that the (increased) settlement offer made by Creation in this instance (as 
recommended by our adjudicator) is appropriate, given the circumstances of Mr P’s 
complaint. It is consistent with our approach to awarding compensation, and with those case 
descriptions and awards.
my final decision
For the reasons explained above, my decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should 
pay compensation of £50 to Mr P, and should remove charges to the value of £55 from his 
account. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2015.

complaint
Miss H complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited (trading as Premium First) 
caused her insurance to be cancelled even though she paid her monthly premium finance 
instalment.
background
Miss H took out a loan with Creation to pay the premium for insurance provided by third 
party insurers via brokers. On 1 December 2014 her direct debit payment failed. Creation 
wrote chasing the missed payment. Miss H sent the money by faster payment on 
16 December but her insurance was cancelled. Miss H says that’s unfair and she wants 
Creation to arrange for the insurance to be reinstated and pay compensation.
Creation says it was up to the brokers to decide whether to cancel the insurance. And it had 
informed Miss H a month previously that payments could take five days to reach her account 
and missed payments might result in cancellation. But she failed to make the payment on 
time.
Our adjudicator doesn’t recommend the complaint should be upheld. She’s satisfied Miss H 
made her payment late and she couldn’t find Creation had done anything wrong in the 
circumstances.
Miss H says Creation gave her another ten days to pay in a letter. And she sent the money 
by faster payment on 16 December so it reached Creation the same day – and within the ten 
days. She considers Creation was wrong to tell the brokers that she hadn’t paid, so it’s 
responsible for the cancellation.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I have reached the same conclusions as 
our adjudicator for much the same reasons.
I understand Miss H’s frustration about what happened. I consider the crux of her complaint 
is that Creation was wrong to report to the brokers on 18 December that she hadn’t made 
her instalment payment - because she had made it two days earlier.
There’s no dispute that Miss H missed her regular monthly loan repayment on the date it 
was due. But she says Creation gave her a further ten days to make the payment in a letter. 
Creation has provided a template of the standard letter it sent Miss H on 4 December. It says 
“failure to pay…within ten days from the date of this letter may result in your insurance being 
cancelled”. I’m satisfied that letter told Miss H she needed to make her payment by 
14 December.
I can see that Miss H considers it’s unfair for the ten days to start to run from the date of the 
letter. And she says the ten days should begin on the date she received it - giving her until 
the 17th or 18th to make the payment. But even if I were to accept Miss H’s view that she 
had until the 18th to make the payment I’m not persuaded she made it in time.
Miss H sent her payment to Creation by faster payment on 16 December. I accept it’s likely 
to have reached Creation within a few hours the same day. But Miss H didn’t include her 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8334161
--------------------------

2
agreement number. And I’m satisfied Creation had told her the month before (during phone 
calls on 14th and 20th November) that

only a card payment over the phone guaranteed that a late payment would reach her 
loan account the same day;

payments made by other methods could take three to five days to reach her account 
so her insurance could be cancelled in the meantime; and

any payment should include the agreement number to avoid delay.
I note Creation’s letter chasing payment also reminded Miss H to include her agreement 
number. And I’m satisfied that Miss H should reasonably have been aware, on 
16 December, that her faster payment could take up to 5 days after that to be allocated to 
her account. I note she says she tried to include her loan agreement number with her bank 
payment – unfortunately it didn’t appear. But I can’t fairly hold Creation responsible for that.
I’m satisfied that Miss H’s payment wasn’t in her loan account on 18 December. So I can’t 
fairly find that Creation was wrong to report a missed payment to the brokers on that date.
I have sympathy for the situation Miss H finds herself in but, for the reasons I have 
explained, I am unable to uphold her complaint. I realise Miss H is likely to be disappointed 
by my decision. But she doesn’t have to accept it and she is free to pursue the matter by any 
other means available to her.
my final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss H to accept or reject my decision before 
5 October 2015.

complaint
Mrs C complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold her a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy when she took out a £2,000 loan by telephone in 2006. The 
cost of the policy was added to the loan and repaid over the loan term.  
background
Our adjudicator said that Mrs C’s complaint should be upheld. They didn’t think Creation had 
told Mrs C she had a choice about buying the policy. And they also didn’t think it properly 
told her how much it would cost. The adjudicator didn’t think Mrs C would have bought the 
policy if she’d known these things.  
Creation disagreed. It said the sales script and loan agreement made clear the policy was 
optional. And the paperwork it sent to Mrs C also explained what the policy cost. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mrs C’s complaint, because:

Creation effectively sold the policy to Mrs C over the phone. So she would have relied 
more on what she was told during the call than on anything she got in writing afterwards. 
But Creation didn’t make clear during the telephone call that Mrs C had a choice about 
buying the policy. 

The script is short. It didn’t tell the call handler to clearly explain that the policy was 
optional, or get Mrs C’s consent to add it to her loan. Although the script said to give 
quotes ‘with and without’ PPI, it isn’t clear how they were explained, or what Mrs C was 
told.  

The brief mention of cancellation rights wasn’t enough to make Mrs C aware she had a 
choice about buying the policy. And it wouldn’t have given her the confidence to cancel 
the policy when Creation hadn’t first clearly told her she had a choice about whether to 
buy it.  

I can see that Mrs C signed for the PPI on the loan agreement. But that didn’t describe 
the PPI as optional. And by then the PPI looked like an integral part of the loan. The 
agreement didn’t say what would happen if Mrs C didn’t sign. 

The script didn’t properly disclose the policy costs. The credit agreement did set out the 
single premium (£462.20) and the total cost of the PPI. But it didn’t set out the interest 
(£205.24) as a separate figure. I don’t think it was reasonable to expect Mrs C to work 
out that figure for herself. She was entitled to expect all the important information about 
the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.


The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mrs C would expect it to be.   

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy either. This would have 
been good practice and it might have helped Mrs C to better understand what the policy 
was costing her.  

I don’t think Mrs C would have bought the policy if she’d been made properly aware she 
had a choice, or if she’d known how much it was going to cost her, compared to the 
amount of the loan and what she was paying for it. 
For these reasons, I uphold Mrs C’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mrs C should be put back in the position she would now be in if she’d taken out the loan 
without the PPI policy. I understand that the loan and PPI ran for their full term.
Creation should now therefore:
A.
Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mrs C because PPI was 
added to the loan by:
•
calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mrs C had taken out the 
loan without PPI;
•
subtracting those amounts from what Mrs C actually paid, and paying her the

•

complaint
Mr C complains about the way Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) amended his 
finance agreement when some items he ordered, and was financing with them, weren’t 
provided.
background
Mr C ordered furniture, in late 2017 and early 2018, from a company I’ll call “H”. He took 
advantage of a 0% APR fixed sum loan from Creation which he used to spread the cost and 
fund the four year deal. The order was comprised of two sofas; a reclining chair; a dining 
table with six chairs and a kitchen table with four chairs.
But H didn’t deliver all of the items. The dining table and chairs weren’t delivered and neither 
were two of the chairs for the kitchen table.
H explained that there were no more dining tables in the country and they couldn’t say when 
a new supply would arrive, other than to explain it would be a minimum of six weeks.
So Mr C sourced a similar item himself and funded it through another deal, with another 
finance company. The deal attracted interest of £95.74. He also sourced some new kitchen 
chairs which he paid for using his debit card.
He was disappointed with the way Creation managed the reduction in his credit agreement 
when they removed the debt for the items that hadn’t been delivered. Creation said they 
couldn’t reduce the value of the instalments but instead they reduced the number of 
instalments. This meant that Mr C’s agreement would be paid off a year earlier. Mr C said 
that wasn’t fair. He wanted them to reduce the size of the instalments instead.
But Creation said that they couldn’t reduce the value of the instalments on a fixed sum loan. 
They didn’t think Mr C had been disadvantaged as there was no interest being paid on the 
debt.
But Mr C disagreed and he referred his complaint to this service. Our investigator didn’t think 
Creation had done enough. He understood that the terms of the fixed sum loan prevented 
any change to the monthly instalment amount but he thought there’d clearly been a breach 
of contract by H, who were Creation’s agents in this agreement, and that Creation were 
therefore responsible. 
He thought Mr C’s actions had been reasonable in the circumstances. He noted that he’d 
just moved into a new house and had nowhere for the family to eat their meals so he 
would’ve wanted to get a new table quickly. And, as there’d been no definitive date for a 
replacement for the one that wasn’t delivered, he thought Mr C was right to find another 
option. He noted that the items Mr C procured were of about the same price he’d been 
looking to finance through Creation but he noted that a 0% deal hadn’t been available to him 
and he’d therefore had to take on a deal in which interest was payable. That interest 
amounted to £95.74 and so he thought a fair resolution of the complaint would be for 
Creation to refund it to Mr C.
But Creation disagreed. They said six weeks wasn’t too long to wait for replacement furniture 
and they shouldn’t be expected to pay another company’s interest charges. So they asked 
for a final decision by an ombudsman.

my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree with the investigator’s view and for similar reasons. Please let me explain why.
Where the information I’ve got is incomplete, unclear or contradictory, as some of it is here I 
have to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
I’ve read and considered the whole file, but I’ll concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I don’t comment on any specific point it’s not because I’ve failed to take it on 
board and think about  it but because I don’t think I need to comment on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
When something goes wrong and the payment was made, in part or whole, with credit, it 
might be possible to make a section 75 claim. This section of the Consumer Credit Act 
(1974) says that in certain circumstances, a finance provider can be responsible for a breach 
of contract or a misrepresentation made by the supplier. 
Here I think it’s clear there has been a breach of contract as the goods that were ordered 
were not delivered in full. So Creation need to put things right.
They’re unwilling to change the monthly instalments as they’ve explained the terms of the 
contract prohibit that. But it’s clear Mr C has been inconvenienced by the matter and I think 
it’s reasonable to compensate him.
He naturally wanted the furniture to be delivered when he moved into his new house and it 
appears that H has been unable to provide him with a firm date of delivery. I can understand 
that, in the circumstances, he would have lost faith in their ability to deliver on time, if at all, 
so I think it was reasonable for him to look elsewhere. 
I think it would be fair to compensate him by returning an amount equivalent to the extra 
financial burden he’s taken on as a result of him having to source his furniture elsewhere. 
The interest that he wouldn’t have paid and now has to under a new agreement, equates to 
£95.74, so I think it’s reasonable to ask Creation to pay this to resolve the matter.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve given above I uphold this complaint and tell Creation Consumer Finance 
Ltd to pay Mr C £95.74 to resolve this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 June 2019.

complaint
Mrs P complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited will not refund to her the money 
that she paid for an alarm system. Her complaint is made against Creation Consumer 
Finance under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. She is being helped with her 
complaint by her husband and a representative.
background
An alarm system was supplied to Mrs P in 2009 which she financed using a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Creation Consumer Finance. In 2014 her representative complained - on her 
behalf - to Creation Consumer Finance under section 75 that the alarm system had been 
misrepresented to Mrs P. Mrs P was not satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service.
The adjudicator did not recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She concluded 
that the original order invoice shows that the credit agreement was for ‘Alarm System only’ 
and she was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to say the purchase was 
misrepresented to Mrs P.
Mrs P’s representative has asked, on her behalf, for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. The representative says, in summary, that the only reason that Mrs P 
proceeded with the purchase was the monitoring, maintenance and response service and 
that she would never have signed any finance agreement stating "Alarm System only" if they 
were aware that no monitoring, maintenance and response service would be provided. The 
representative has also provided documents in support of Mrs P’s complaint.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if there has been a breach of contract 
or misrepresentation by the supplier. To be able to uphold Mrs P’s complaint about Creation 
Consumer Finance under section 75, I must be satisfied that there has been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the alarm system.
Mrs P clearly feels very strongly that she has paid for both the alarm and a monitoring 
service and she has provided a number of documents to support her complaint. However, 
she paid for the service using a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance. 
The pre-contract information that was provided by Creation Consumer Finance says that the 
credit was being provided for an “alarm system only – no monitoring” and the credit 
agreement that was signed by Mrs P in February 2009 says that the credit was being 
provided for “intruder alarm and installation only”. Immediately above Mrs P’s signature on 
the credit agreement are the words: “This is a Credit Agreement regulated by the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its terms”.
Although Mrs P may have understood that she was purchasing an alarm and monitoring 
system, I consider that it is clear from the credit agreement that Creation Consumer Finance 
was only providing credit for the alarm system and not the monitoring. I am therefore not 
persuaded that there is enough evidence to show that Creation Consumer Finance is liable

to Mrs P under section 75 for any breach of contract or misrepresentation about the 
monitoring service. I therefore do not consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Creation Consumer Finance to refund to Mrs P the money 
that she had paid for the alarm or to pay her any other compensation.
 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I do not uphold Mrs P’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mrs P to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 May 2015.

complaint
Mrs D complains that she didn’t receive a copy of a loan agreement she entered into with 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. She’s unhappy that the interest free period has expired and 
that Creation is charging interest.
background
In March 2016 Mrs D placed an order for a new kitchen and entered into an agreement with 
Creation. The kitchen was installed later in 2016. The terms of the loan agreement included 
a 12 month Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) interest free period, which ran from the date when 
the kitchen was installed.
Mrs D says she didn’t receive a copy of the loan agreement and didn’t know who to make 
payments to during the BNPL period. She says she tried to obtain information from the 
supplier of the kitchen but it was unable to help, so she waited to hear from the loan 
company.
Mrs D says she didn’t hear anything from Creation until 2018, after the BNPL period had 
expired. She’s unhappy that she’s being charged interest on the loan. To resolve her 
complaint she wants 12 months to repay the loan without being charged any interest.
Our investigator didn’t uphold the complaint. She said it was likely that the loan agreement 
was either given to Mrs D in-store or emailed to her. She said the loan agreement made it 
clear that if the account wasn’t settled by the end of the 12 month BNPL period any interest 
accrued during that period would be chargeable.
Mrs D didn’t agree. She said she had gone to great efforts to obtain a copy of the loan 
agreement so that she could make payments during the BNPL period. She felt Creation 
should have written to her following installation to check that everything was satisfactory.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I’ve looked at the loan agreement and I can see that Mrs D electronically signed this on 24 
April 2016. I appreciate that Mrs D says she’s never been provided with a copy of the loan 
agreement. I don’t doubt what Mrs D says about not being able to find a copy of the 
agreement in the folder she was given by the retailer. But I think it’s likely that the agreement 
was emailed to Mrs D, because Creation has advised that it was provided with details of Mrs 
D’s email address when she entered into the agreement.
Even if Mrs D couldn’t find the agreement that was emailed to her, I’m satisfied that she 
could have looked at the agreement online. Creation has explained that Mrs D would’ve 
been able to view the agreement including any payment due dates on her online account. 
Although Mrs D says she didn’t know who her loan was with, Creation has told this service 
that she accessed her online account and has actively used it.
It’s unfortunate that the retailer wasn’t able to provide Mrs D with the information she 
wanted. I appreciate that this must have caused frustration to Mrs D. However, based on the 
available information, I’m satisfied that the loan agreement was provided to Mrs D and that 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8411122
--------------------------

2
she was in a position to discover the identity of the loan provider and make payments during 
the BNPL period had she wanted to do so.
I’ve also taken into account that Creation wrote to Mrs D approximately one month before 
the expiry of the BNPL period to remind her that the offer period was ending. 
I understand Mrs D is unhappy because she’s been charged interest. The terms of the 
agreement include a 12 month BNPL period. If Mrs D had paid the balance during the first 
12 months she wouldn’t have been charged any interest. But the terms of the agreement are 
clear that if the balance isn’t paid before the end of the BNPL period, interest will be 
charged. Because of this I’m unable to say that Creation has made an error in charging 
interest.
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’m satisfied that Mrs D was provided with a copy of the loan 
agreement at the time when she entered into it. I’m also satisfied that Mrs D was aware that 
the agreement had a 12 month BNPL period after which interest would be charged if the 
account hadn’t been settled. Mrs D didn’t settle the account within the BNPL period so 
interest has been correctly charged.
my final decision
My final decision is that I don’t uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2019.

complaint
Mr and Mrs C have complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) has 
unfairly declined their claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“CCA”).
background
Mr and Mrs C attended a sales presentation by a business I’ll call Business T where they 
were told about a holiday Club. Mr and Mrs C already had a timeshare, but they had to pay 
maintenance fees annually, and they hoped to be able to give this up to save on fees. They 
say they were told Business T would take over their existing timeshare, deal with any 
maintenance fees, and enrol them in a ‘cashback’ scheme ran by a business I’ll call 
Business CB, if they agreed to become members of a holiday club I’ll call Club C. Mr and 
Mrs C thought membership entitled them to discounted accommodation and other benefits 
and the cashback scheme would cover the cost of the membership after three years. The 
total cost was £7,509.66. Mr and Mrs C paid Business T £2,180.66 using Mrs C’s Creation 
credit card and the rest was paid by bank transfer from Mrs C’s account.1 
Mr and Mrs C have said Business T didn’t take over their existing timeshare and they didn’t 
get the discounted accommodation or other discounts they thought they’d get through 
Club C. They say they were promised by Business T’s sales representative that they would 
get all of their membership costs back through the cashback scheme, but again they didn’t 
get what they were promised. Mr and Mrs C say Business T either misrepresented the 
benefits of the Club C membership and cashback scheme or were in breach of contract for 
not providing those benefits. They also say that Business T subjected them to high pressure 
sales techniques and said this was the only way to get out of their existing timeshare – in 
fact their existing timeshare provider allowed them to give up their membership directly.
As Mr and Mrs C had paid Business T partly using a credit card, they asked Creation to 
refund the full purchase price as they felt Creation was jointly liable for any breach of 
contract or misrepresentation under s.75 CCA.
But Creation turned down Mr and Mrs C’s claim as it said the way the agreement was set up 
and paid for meant s.75 CCA didn’t apply. It said that provision only meant it was liable if the 
purchase price had been paid to the supplier of the service. But payment was made to 
Business T and the services were actually supplied by different businesses, so Creation 
didn’t think it needed to pay anything to Mr and Mrs C. Unhappy with its response, they 
brought their complaint to this service.
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and thought it should have been upheld. 
They thought there was a misrepresentation that Mr and Mrs C would get money through the 
cashback scheme, so they recommended Creation pay compensation.
Creation disagreed for the same reasons as before and asked for the complaint to be looked 
at again. A different investigator reviewed the file and agreed that Creation had dealt with the 
matter fairly. They said that Creation could be liable for any breach of contract or 
misrepresentation about the contract Mr and Mrs C entered into with Business T, but the 
matters complained about were things that were done by different businesses. So they didn’t 
1 Both Mr and Mrs C brought the complaint to our service, but only Mrs C is an eligible complainant as 
the credit card used was hers. As Mr and Mrs C went through the purchase process together, I have 
referred to both of them in this decision, but it would be for Mrs C to accept any final decision and any 
compensation needs to be paid to Mrs C only.

think Creation was jointly responsible for what went wrong. Mr and Mrs C disagreed, so the 
complaint was passed to me for a decision.
Having considered all of the available evidence and arguments, I came to a different 
conclusion to out investigator and thought the complaint should have been upheld. I issued a 
provisional decision that set out my thoughts at that stage and invited both parties to send 
me in anything further they wanted me to think about before I issued a final decision. Below 
is an extract from my provisional decision:
“In this complaint I think it’s important to first set out what I find Mr and Mrs C agreed 
to, with which business and whether they have any cause of action against those 
businesses for a breach of contract or misrepresentation. I’ll then look at whether that 
is something Creation needs to consider given the relationships between the parties. 
Finally, if I find Creation has to consider any claim, I’ll think about whether it has 
properly considered that claim.
Mr and Mrs C’s agreements
I’ve set out above what Mr and Mrs C have said they thought they were buying from 
Business T. So I’ve looked at the available documents to see whether they reflect 
what Mr and Mrs C thought they were signing up to.
Mr and Mrs C signed a document titled “MEMBERSHIP APPLICATION” on 13 
September 2007 that reads:
“This agreement is made by [Business T], whose registered address is 
[ADDRESS], for the purpose of purchasing membership to the [Club C]. As 
follows:-“
Mr and Mrs C’s details are recorded and there is a section titled “To be completed 
by the marketer”. It sets out the total price, £7,600, and breaks this down into 
£2,280 to be paid by credit card and £5,320 by bank transfer. At the bottom of the 
page Mr and Mrs C have signed just below where it reads:
“I confirm the details provided are accurate and correct, and that I have fully 
read, understood and agree to the terms and conditions attached hereto.”
The terms and conditions have been supplied by Mr and Mrs C, so I think they had a 
copy provided to them. They run to three pages, so I think it’s likely Mr and Mrs C 
would have had the chance to read them before they signed the contract – they 
haven’t said they didn’t have this chance and I see they have signed the terms 
separately to say they have read them. This document sets out some of what Club C 
did for its members and, although Business T’s logo appears on the top of the page, 
Business T isn’t actually mentioned by name in any of the terms. Some of the most 
relevant parts read as follows:

Addendum 1.0 [Club C] Membership
Platinum Membership entitles you to:

[IT GOES ON TO LIST OTHER TRAVEL AND LEISURE BENEFITS]”
Having seen Mrs C’s credit card receipts and the balance transfer, they paid slightly 
less than the price set out on the contract (£7,509.66 instead of £7,600). I’m not 
entirely sure why they paid less, but I don’t think it makes a difference for the purpose 
of this decision.
What is clear is that the membership application and attached terms don’t contain all 
of the agreement between Mr and Mrs C and Business T. I say this because it makes 
no mention of the cashback offer or how Business T were going to take over their 
existing timeshare. So I need to consider everything Mr and Mrs C were told as well 
as all of the other evidence available to work out what the arrangements were 
between the parties. I think it would be helpful to set out separately the three things 
Mr and Mrs C say they were getting, what I find the terms of the agreement were, 
and whether I think there may have been any breach of contract or 
misrepresentation.
a.
Club C membership
I think the documents available show that Mr and Mrs C bought membership of 
Club C, and they suggest that was from Business T. The membership cost £7,429 
and lasted indefinitely, subject to the payment of an annual subscription fee (£95 at 
the time they took out the agreement). Once Business T took payment it was for 
Club C to send to Mr and Mrs C their “Membership and membership documents”.
In addition, once the membership was started, there was some sort of relationship 
between Mr and Mrs C and Club C, who ran the membership and its benefits. 
Although the application above says the agreement is with Business T, all of the 
services are described as being provided by Club C or its agents, but none by 
Business T. Similarly, Club C has attempted to limit its liability for any breach of the 
contract terms and says that it can vary the terms of the agreement, which implies 
there is a contractual relationship between Mr and Mrs C and Club C.
“Indefinite” isn’t defined in the contract and there’s no description about how this 
would work in practice, for example, whether Mr or Mrs C could pass their indefinite 
membership onto another person. This is important as Club C was wound up in 
2012, so their membership didn’t last forever.
I’ve thought about the general principles of construction and interpretation of 
contracts, having regard to the contract as a whole and how these types of contract 
operate in practice. I think the description of the membership being “indefinite subject 
to an annual subscription fee”, implies that upon payment on an annual fee, Mr and 
Mrs C were able to access the benefits of Club C membership that year. And, if that 
fee wasn’t paid, they weren’t able to access those benefits. I think this is slightly 
different to a contract that can be renewed annually, such as a contract of insurance, 
as it means the decision on whether to continue lay solely with Mr and Mrs C rather

DRN8425726
--------------------------

5
than with Club C. So there was a large membership joining fee and a much smaller 
annual fee thereafter.
It is unclear to whom Mr and Mrs C are supposed to pay the annual subscription fee, 
as it just says the membership to Club C is indefinite, subject to the annual 
subscription fee. I’ve seen some demands for payment from Club C in 2012, 
instructing Mr and Mrs C to pay its accountants, but that’s not set out in the terms 
that were provided at the time of sale. But I’m satisfied that Club C felt there was an 
ongoing obligation on Mr and Mrs C to pay the fees. I can’t see there were any 
ongoing contractual relations between Mr and Mrs C and Business T with respect to 
Club C membership after it was arranged and all of the benefits are provided by 
Club C.
On the front of the membership application only Business T’s logo appears and it 
says the agreement is made by Business T “for the purpose of purchasing 
membership to” Club C. And in the terms and conditions it says “I/we understand that 
the company whose details appear on the front side of this application is an 
independent entity authorised to sell memberships to [Club C].” So I think there was 
a contract between Mr and Mrs C and Business T for Business T to procure 
membership to Club C. They paid for this partly using Mrs C’s Creation credit card 
and partly using a bank transfer. Membership was arranged as set out under the 
contract.
But I also think that at the same time Business T was entering into a contract in its 
own name, it was also acting as an agent for Club C. I think there was a contractual 
relationship between Club C and Mr and Mrs C – once they had paid for membership 
it was supplied by Club C (paragraph 10 of the section of the terms titled 
Membership) and Club C provided them all of the benefits of membership. But Mr 
and Mrs C didn’t have any dealings with Club C directly, so I think the only way it 
could have entered into a contract with them was through the use of an agent. 
In short, Business T approached Mr and Mrs C, marketed a package of holiday 
benefits, including Club C membership, and took payment from them. But the actual 
Club C membership, and the associated benefits, appears to be supplied by Club C 
after Business T has sent the “completion details”. So I think there were two 
contracts, one between Mr and Mrs C and Business T and one between Mr and 
Mrs C and Club C.
In 2011 the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills petitioned for 
Club C to be wound up (“the Petition”). I’ve seen a copy of the Petition that was 
presented to the Court. It names a number of companies that were linked with the 
principal activity of selling membership to Club C. The Petition alleged that the 
companies were linked by the involvement of the same individuals, but the overall 
structure of the group was difficult to penetrate and that meant the controlling parties 
had remained hidden. The Petition was presented on the basis that Club C was 
involved in misleading customers, including making misleading representations about 
how it could help people out of existing timeshare obligations and presenting a 
complex and possibly insolvent cashback scheme. Club C was wound up by the 
Court in October 2012.
Mr and Mrs C say they didn’t get what they’d been promised by taking out Club C 
membership. And Club C was wound up in 2012, so their membership wasn’t

indefinite. But I think it’s clear that anything offered by Club C to its members was 
provided by Club C and not Business T. In other words, I can’t see the Business T 
could be held responsible for a breach of contract due to Club C’s failures. And I 
don’t think Mr and Mrs C’s contract with Business T was breached by Club C being 
wound up in 2012. I think the agreement between Business T and Mr and Mrs C, so 
far as Club C membership was concerned, was simply to arrange membership. That 
was done and I don’t think Business T has breached that contract. It’s possible Mr 
and Mrs C have a claim for breach of contract against Club C, but for the reasons I’ll 
set out below, I don’t think that is something Creation has to answer.
Business T told Mr and Mrs C things about the benefits of Club C membership when 
they decided to take it out. In particular they have said that they “would never have to 
pay full price for a holiday again” and they could get cheap luxury holidays. Mr and 
Mrs C say they were shown a website during a sales presentation that shows 
examples of what was available, but when they came to try to book, the holidays 
were the same price or more expensive than that available through other travel 
agents. 
These are things that Mr and Mrs C say were misrepresented to them and it’s 
possible that these representations could have induced them to enter into an 
agreement with Business T for the things it provided, as well as with Club C for the 
membership benefits. So I’ve considered those representations and whether I think 
there is something further that needs to be considered by Creation.
I have no reason to doubt that Mr and Mrs C’s memories of what they were told are 
correct. But I don’t think there’s enough evidence available to me to say the 
representations were untrue. Mr and Mrs C haven’t provided any screenshots or 
other supporting evidence as to the types of holidays available to Club C members 
and the costs of those holidays. I understand Mr and Mrs C say that they could get 
the same holidays cheaper elsewhere, but I don’t have anything to show these were 
like for like comparisons of the same holidays, at the same time, and with the same 
things included in the price. And even if Mr and Mrs C were able to find a particular 
holiday package cheaper elsewhere, it doesn’t mean that Club C didn’t offer some 
sort of discount from the “full price”, albeit a smaller one. So based on what I have 
seen I’m not able to conclude that Business T misrepresented the benefits of Club C 
membership.
b.
the cashback offer
There isn’t any documentary evidence to show how the cashback offer was 
presented to Mr and Mrs C or any terms they agreed to at the time. But Mr and Mrs C 
have provided their recollections which I accept are as clear and honest as possible, 
given the time since the sale. They have said that after three years they thought they 
could apply for £10,100 cashback through the scheme, but by buying Club C 
membership they were guaranteed to receive back at least the cost of their Club C 
membership. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8425726
--------------------------

7
On 13 September 2007, the day Mr and Mrs C applied for Club C membership, 
Business T sent them a letter that read:
“This letter is to confirm that the [Business CB] offer which you have received 
is free of charge and for the value of £10,100.
Your certificate will be sent to you by registered post, simply return as direct. 
Your claim will then be processed and the funds received after 36 months.”
Mr and Mrs C say they didn’t get their certificate and had to go back to Business T on 
another date to get it issued to them. Mr and Mrs C have provided a copy of the 
“CashBack Certificate”. It reads:
“This is to confirm that upon completion of the below numbered 
contract/invoice number (product reference number) you will be issued with a 
CASHBACK EURO VOUCHER by [Business CB].
Your Euro Voucher will be sent to you by registered post. Upon receipt simply 
follow the terms and conditions on the reverse of the Euro Voucher and 
[Business CB] will then process your claim.”
The certificate makes clear that it relates to Mr and Mrs C’s membership agreement, 
with Business T named as the merchants. It says the voucher amount was £10,100. 
The certificate isn’t dated. I’ve also seen a one-page document that sets out how to 
register under the scheme and make a claim, as well as some terms and conditions. 
On 23 June 2008, Business CB sent Mr and Mrs C their “Euro Voucher” with another 
set of terms and conditions of how to register to get a payment. Mr and Mrs C did 
register, but they were later told they hadn’t done so in the right way and had 
breached the terms of the offer, so nothing was paid to them.
 
I haven’t seen anything to show that Business T and Business CB are linked 
businesses, so I can’t say that Business T ran the cashback scheme or had control 
over how it paid out money. So it’s necessary to make a decision about whether Mr 
and Mrs C contracted with Business CB or Business T, or both.
I’m satisfied that Mr and Mrs C didn’t have access to the terms and conditions 
detailed on the certificate before they entered into an agreement with Business T. I 
say that because they have explained that they had to return to get the certificate 
after the sale and the actual voucher was sent out around nine months later. That 
means I don’t think I can say Mr and Mrs C entered into a contract with any party 
based on the terms and conditions sent out later. 
But I think the terms and conditions are helpful to set out who the parties are and 
how Business T and Business CB intended it to work. It says:
“This promotional [Business CB] Euro Voucher has been presented to you, 
the named holder(s), …on behalf of the Euro Voucher owners, 
[Business CB]…
This Euro Voucher is part of the [Business CB], Euro Voucher programme…
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8425726
--------------------------

8
The merchant has entered into an agreement with [Business CB] to gift Euro 
Vouchers to its customers and has agreed to effect payments in respect 
thereof to the custodian in the sum of 12% of the value of each presented 
Euro Voucher…
On receipt of the monies from the merchant, the custodians will pay 45% 
thereof into a custodian account to be used for the purpose of paying those 
named holders who have successfully registered their intent to claim…
Subject to both stages of the claim process being completed in the manner 
specified in the Terms and Conditions herein, the custodian will be instructed 
to issue the relevant payments to the named holders…
…these terms and conditions are the whole agreement between you, the 
merchant and [Business CB] and you may not rely on any oral or written 
representations made to you which are not included in these terms and 
conditions in any way whatsoever”
On the Cashback Certificate, Business T are named as the merchants. In Mr and 
Mrs C’s case, Business T would have paid 12% of the voucher value (£1,212) to the 
custodians – they are a named firm of accountants. The custodians put £545.40 into 
an account from which cashback is later paid. The contract doesn’t make clear what 
happens to the remainder of the money paid, but as the scheme is run by 
Business CB, it is assumed that it took the remainder.
The terms and conditions set out how Business CB work out how much each 
successful consumer would get back and how it instructs the custodian to pay money 
out. The only role the merchant (Business T) had was to make the initial payment 
into the scheme. In the terms, Business CB accept that there is some sort of 
agreement between itself and Mr and Mrs C (and Business T), but I think that any 
agreement for the administration and payment of the cashback scheme was between 
the consumer and Business CB.
In the Petition referred to above, it was alleged that an incentive to take out Club C 
membership was the chance to join a cashback scheme run by Business CB. The 
Petition alleged the scheme was set up, funded and managed by the same 
individuals that controlled Club C. The Petition describes the scheme requirements to 
get any cashback are “onerous and calculated to ensure that only 32% of all 
applicants successfully register and can therefore expect to receive a payout”. It was 
estimated that a successful applicant would likely only receive around 17% of the 
voucher value. And when Mr and Mrs C came to claim they received nothing.
I’ve thought about what agreement, if any, Mr and Mrs C entered into with 
Business T with respect to cashback. I don’t think they had an agreement with 
Business T that it would provide cashback to Mr and Mrs C after three years, either 
directly or by using Business CB to fulfil its part of the agreement. I say that because 
Mr and Mrs C haven’t said that’s how they understood the cashback would work. 
They have talked about a ‘scheme’ under which they could ‘apply’ for cashback, and 
they haven’t said they thought Business T was going to pay it. 
On balance, I think it’s most likely that Business T told Mr and Mrs C they would be 
enrolled on a cashback scheme they could claim on three years later. And I think the

arrangements between Mr and Mrs C, Business T and Business CB were similar to 
the arrangements for Club C membership as set out above. Although the terms 
provided later to Mr and Mrs C state that Business T was to pay £1,212 to join the 
scheme, I can’t be sure how that money way actually paid as this would have been in 
addition to the cost of Club C membership – as noted in the Petition, Club C and 
Business CB were linked businesses, so it may be that they reached some 
agreement between them as to how to divide up what was paid. But I think the actual 
contractual relationship to provide cashback was between Mr and Mrs C and 
Business CB, with Business T acting as Business CB’s agent. For the reasons I’ll 
explain further below, I don’t think I need to make a finding as to the terms of the 
arrangement between Mr and Mrs C and Business CB as I don’t think Creation 
needs to answer any claim for breach of that contract. 
However, as with Club C membership, I also think there was a contract between Mr 
and Mrs C and Business T for Business T to procure enrolment with Business CB. 
This was paid for in the same way, partly using Mrs C’s Creation credit card and 
partly using a bank transfer. But I can’t see that this contract was breached by 
Business CB not providing Mr and Mrs C cashback later on. I think the agreement 
between Business T and Mr and Mrs C, so far as cashback was concerned, was 
simply to procure enrolment to the scheme. That was done and I don’t think 
Business T has breached that contract. 
But I do think any representation made by Business T about the cashback scheme 
could be relevant to Mr and Mrs C’s claim against Creation. Based on what I’ve seen 
so far, I think it’s more likely that not that Business T made a representation that Mr 
and Mrs C were likely to get back 100% of their certificate value and guaranteed to 
get back their Club C membership cost, if they took out Club C membership. As I 
said before, I don’t think they were told how to claim until they’d already paid 
Business T and entered into an agreement with them. The only written evidence from 
the time of sale, the letter of 13 September 2007 as set out in full above, doesn’t 
explain that they could receive less the amounts Business T said they would get. At 
the time Mr and Mrs C entered into the contract, Business T would have known how 
much it had had to pay to Business CB and how a customer needed to make a claim. 
So I think it must have known no claim value was guaranteed and that it was 
complex and onerous to make a claim. But it didn’t explain this to Mr and Mrs C to 
correct the false representation I find it made to them about the sums they were 
guaranteed to get. It follows, I think Business T knowingly misled Mr and Mrs C.
I also think it was reasonable for Mr and Mrs C to rely on this claim, even though the 
certificate value was higher than the amount they paid Business T. That is because 
they were giving up an existing timeshare and I think they would have thought the 
cashback sum was higher to reflect that.
At present I am minded to find that Mr and Mrs C relied on this representation when 
entering into the contract with Business T and it was one of the main reasons for 
doing so – plainly a guarantee of a substantial pay-out in the future would be 
something that most people would think important. And I think if Mr and Mrs C knew 
this wasn’t guaranteed, they wouldn’t have decided to enter into any agreement with 
Business T.

c.
taking over Mr and Mrs C’s existing timeshare
Mr and Mrs C say that Business T told them it would take over their existing 
timeshare if they took out Club C membership – in fact they say they were told this 
was the only way of getting out of their existing timeshare. Mr and Mrs C say this was 
framed as a one-time offer and, if they wanted Business T to take over their 
timeshare, they had to sign up on the day. 
But Mr and Mrs C say Business T never took over their timeshare and they were still 
chased for maintenance fees. They say they were told by their timeshare provider 
that Business T had never made contact to take over or cancel the timeshare and 
that Mr and Mrs C could have given it up directly with their provider. Mr and Mrs C 
stopped paying their maintenance fees and their timeshare provider took their 
timeshare back without any further charge.
Again, I’ve seen nothing in writing showing what agreement there was between 
Business T and Mr and Mrs C about their existing timeshare. So I’ve looked at what 
evidence is available to work out what I think was most likely agreed.
On the same day that Mr and Mrs C signed the Club C membership application, 
Business T sent them a letter stating:
“Should you wish to use your week in Malta, in the next 36 months you may, 
and will thus be liable for the maintenance payment.
Should [Mr and Mrs C’s timeshare provider] cease to run their rental 
programme during this period, and you are unable to privately rent your week 
please provide [Business T] with proof of the above, along with that of 
payment for maintenance and a valid guest certificate and we will reimburse 
these fees.”
During the end of 2007 and into early 2008, there were several emails between Mr 
and Mrs C and Business T to get the “guest certificate” needed and the payment of 
the 2008 timeshare maintenance fees refunded. Mr and Mrs C explained that they 
needed more information from Business T – a set of dates to tell their timeshare 
provider – before a guest certificate could be issued. They pointed out that they 
weren’t able to do this, and it was Business T that was holding this up. 
On 5 February 2008, Business T emailed Mr and Mrs C:
“We need a copy of your maintenance bill and a copy of the proof of payment 
as stated on the letter from [Business T]…”
And Business T sent the following letter on 7 February 2008:
“Your file has been passed to me in order to process payment of your 2008 
maintenance fees.
At the time of Membership Application you were issued a letter by 
[Business T] stating the conditions that must be fulfilled to obtain this 
payment. You have not provided proof that you have been unable to rent your

weeks with [Mr and Mrs C’s timeshare provider] or privately, and until such 
proof is received re-payment cannot be made.
In addition we require a guest certificate(s) from [Mr and Mrs C’s timeshare 
provider] in order for us to be able to use your timeshare weeks/points.”
On the same day Mr and Mrs C sent a copy of their invoice and receipt for the 
maintenance fees. It’s not clear whether these fees were ever refunded.
From the detailed correspondence, I think it is clear Mr and Mrs C were under the 
impression that Business T was to arrange their release or take over their existing 
timeshare and pay the ongoing maintenance fees before that happened. And there’s 
nothing in the correspondence from Business T that contradicts that, rather 
Business T appear to be taking on responsibility to pay the fees if Mr and Mrs C 
provide certain details. This fits with what Mr and Mrs C say about Business T taking 
over their timeshare.
Mr and Mrs C’s agreement with Business T was an oral agreement and wasn’t set 
out in writing. But I think it was part of the overall package of things Business T 
agreed to supply for the payments set out above. I think there was a term that 
Business T would try to procure Mr and Mrs C’s release from their timeshare and that 
it would reimburse any fees that they had to pay before it closed or formally took over 
responsibility for the timeshare. I also don’t think there is any evidence to suggest 
that Business T did this.
But I also think that Mr and Mrs C were told this was the only way to get out of their 
existing timeshare. And, as detailed above, this wasn’t the case – they were able to 
get out of their timeshare without Business T’s assistance. So this was a 
misrepresentation made by Business T to try to get Mr and Mrs C to agree to take 
out the various agreements it was offering. Mr and Mrs C have told us that the main 
reason they bought anything from Business T was because they wanted to get out of 
their existing timeshare. Had they not been misled that they could only do this with 
Business T’s assistance, I don’t think they would have entered into any agreements 
with Business T. 
d.
Conclusion
I think Mr and Mrs C entered into an agreement with Business T for it to procure their 
release from their timeshare and management fee responsibilities and to procure 
Club C membership and cashback enrolment . And, at the same time, I think it acted 
as an agent for Club C and Business CB to arrange the Club C membership and 
enrol them in the cashback scheme. For this package of things, Mr and Mrs C paid a 
total, undivided sum of £7,509.66 to Business T. 
Based on what I’ve seen so far, I think it’s likely Business T misrepresented the 
benefits of the cashback scheme and the need to enter into an agreement at all to 
get out of their existing timeshare. I also think it’s likely Business T breached its 
contract with Mr and Mrs C to procure their release from the timeshare and take over 
the payment of management fees.

It may be that Club C and Business CB breached their agreements with Mr and 
Mrs C too. But for the purposes of this decision, I propose to make no finding on 
those issues.
Are Creation jointly responsible for any misrepresentations or breaches of contract?
S.75 CCA states that in certain circumstances, where a debtor has a claim against a 
supplier in respect of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, they will have a like 
claim against the creditor. So here, Mrs C (the debtor) is asking Creation (the 
creditor) to answer her claim (on her and her husband’s behalf) for misrepresentation 
and breach of contract over the problems I’ve set out above.
But this doesn’t apply to every claim Mrs C may have. Creation are only responsible 
for claims where there is a debtor-creditor-supplier (“DCS”) agreement in place. This 
is set out more fully in s.11(b) and s.12(b) CCA, but in short, there have to be 
arrangements in place so that the supplier of goods or services is paid using the 
credit card. In Mr and Mrs C’s case, Mrs C paid Business T directly, so it is not in 
dispute that Creation could be held jointly responsible for any claim of a breach of the 
contract with Business T or of a misrepresentation that led Mr and Mrs C into 
entering into an agreement with Business T.
But I don’t think Creation has to answer any claim for breach of contract by Club C or 
Business CB. That is because anything supplied by those businesses was outside of 
the arrangements between Mrs C, Business T and Creation. Under the CCA, it’s 
possible Creation would have to answer a claim if it could be shown either Club C or 
Business CB were ‘associates’ (s.184 and s.187 CCA). But nothing I have seen 
makes me think they were associates under the Act, nor are Business T mentioned 
as a linked company in the Petition referred to above. It follows I don’t think Creation 
needs to answer any claim for breach of contract by Club C or Business CB as there 
isn’t a DCS agreement in place.
I’ve also considered whether there is any misrepresentation claim based on anything 
Business T said that caused Mr and Mrs C to enter into an agreement with Club C or 
Business CB. As set out above, I didn’t find Business T made a misrepresentation 
about Club C membership, but I did think it likely misrepresented how the cashback 
scheme worked. It could be argued that things Business T said about the scheme 
were representations made on behalf of Business CB that could be looked at in any 
claim against Business CB for misrepresentation. But for the same reason as I think 
Creation doesn’t need to answer a claim for breach of contract against Business CB, 
I don’t think it needs to answer a claim for misrepresentation that induced Mr and Mrs 
C to enter into that agreement. 
But Mr and Mrs C did enter into an agreement with Business T directly as set out 
above. And I don’t think it is in dispute that there is the right sort of DCS relationship, 
so Creation could be jointly liable for any claim. So I think Creation could be jointly 
liable for the breach of contract if it’s found that Business T didn’t do anything with 
respect to Mr and Mrs C’s existing timeshare. 
I also note that everything sold to Mr and Mrs C was sold as a package – there’s no 
evidence that they could have got one thing without the other. So a representation 
about one part of the package could have induced them into buying the package as a 
whole. I think all of the representations made by Business T can be considered when

thinking about a claim for misrepresentation against Business T and, it follows, any 
like claim against Creation.
 
Has Creation properly considered the claims?
Creation has previously said it wouldn’t consider Mr and Mrs C’s breach of contract 
claims about the Club C membership and cashback as it didn’t think there were the 
right sort of relationship between it and Club C and Business CB. For the reasons set 
out above, I broadly agree with Creation and think it acted fairly.
But I do think it needed to assess Mr and Mrs C’s claim where there is the right type 
of DCS link with Business T. As Creation hasn’t done so, I will consider that part of 
the complaint now.
Mr and Mrs C have asked for a refund of what they paid to Business T. That is an 
outcome that normally follows a successful claim for misrepresentation. As set out 
above, I have found that there were two misrepresentations made to them, one that 
the cashback was guaranteed and one that the only way to get out of their existing 
timeshare was by instructing Business T to do that for them. For a claim to be 
successful, I’d have to find that these misrepresentations induced them to enter into 
the agreements, in other words that Mr and Mrs C wouldn’t have carried on with their 
purchases if they knew the full facts about what they were buying. 
Mr and Mrs C’s written agreement solely deals with Club C membership, so on the 
face of it this looks like that what the main purpose of the agreement. But I don’t think 
that was the case. Mr and Mrs C had an existing timeshare that they wished to 
relinquish, along with the annual service charges. They were told that they could 
achieve that by taking out a package that included Club C membership and an offer 
of cashback that covered the cost of Club C membership – in other words, they 
would have got what they wanted along with Club C membership at no net cost. I 
haven’t seen any evidence that Mr and Mrs C were interested in Club C membership 
on its own and I don’t think they would have bought the package if they knew that 
either they didn’t need it to get out of their existing timeshare or that the cashback 
wasn’t guaranteed. 
Taking the above into account, I think Creation should have upheld Mrs C’s claim if it 
had properly considered it.”
Mrs C and Creation both responded to say they had nothing further to add.
my findings
I’ve again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has given me anything further they want me to consider, I see no reason to 
depart from my provisional decision. 
For the reasons set out in my provisional decision as set out above, I uphold this complaint 
and direct Creation to pay compensation to put Mrs C into the financial position she would 
be in now had she not entered into an agreement with Business T. So it should:


Work out what Mrs C would owe on her credit card today, or at the date the card was 
closed if applicable, if she hadn’t paid anything to Business T on 13 September 2007. 
So it needs to remove the £2,180.66 paid, plus any interest charged on that sum. It 
should also remove any charges that were caused by the payment being made to 
Business T, as well as any interest added to those charges.
Creation should then pay Mrs C the difference between her credit card balance and 
what it would have been as worked out above.
If, when Creation works out what Mrs C would have owed without paying Business T, 
she paid more than she needed to because of the payments to Business T, Creation 
should also pay compensatory interest on the extra she paid. The interest rate is 8% 
per year simple from when the extra payment was made to the date of settlement.*

Pay Mrs C £5,329 that was paid to Business T by bank transfer on 25 October 2007, 
along with compensatory interest at the rate of 8% per year simple to the date of 
settlement.*

Refund the annual fees Mrs C paid CCC of £95 on 14 September 2009 and on 14 
April 2010, along with compensatory interest at the rate of 8% per year simple from 
the date of payment to the date of settlement*
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from any compensatory interest awarded 
and it should let Mrs C know how much tax has been deducted.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs C’s complaint against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd and direct it pays 
compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 July 2021.

complaint
Mr S complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd didn’t send him annual statements for 
his loan account.
background
Mr S took out the loan in July 2013. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd said a third party, acting 
on its behalf, sent him the statements on each anniversary of the loan agreement.
The adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. She asked Creation 
Consumer Finance for evidence that it’d sent annual statements to Mr S but it said it didn’t 
have any. She issued her opinion letter and then Creation said it had evidence that it’d sent 
Mr S an annual statement in August 2014.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I’ve seen the evidence Creation relies on but although it gives a statement end date of 
4 August 2014 I don’t think that’s sufficient to show it sent the statement to Mr S. So I have 
come to the same conclusions as the adjudicator for much the same reasons.
Creation Consumer Finance has an obligation to send Mr S annual statements for his loan 
account. It can’t provide any evidence it has done so. In light of section 77A of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 I’m satisfied it should refund Mr S the interest it’s charged him from 
July 2013 to July 2015.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement I require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Mr S:

All interest payments on his loan account from 21 July 2013 to 21 July 2015.

£50 compensation for the inconvenience it’s caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2016.

complaint
Miss C complains she hasn’t been provided with a service she paid for with the aid of a loan 
from Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“the firm”). The supplier is insolvent and the firm has 
refused to refund the money she’s spent.
background
In 2009 Miss C purchased a monitored alarm system for her home. She says she agreed to 
the purchase because she was told that the system would be monitored to help protect her 
in the event of a burglary or fire. 
Miss C said the monitoring and maintenance service was to last 15 years. She paid £5,049 
for the system, using a fixed term loan on a ten-year term, although interest on the loan 
meant the eventual amount she paid was £5,964.46.
Soon after the sale the supplier got into financial difficulties and is currently in liquidation. 
This meant the maintenance and monitoring service was only provided for 25 months before 
the supplier stopped trading, but Miss C had to continue making payments to the firm under 
the terms of her loan.
Miss C complained about this via a representative. The firm responded to say the loan was 
for the alarm itself, and that the monitoring and maintenance service was not included in the 
price of the agreement. It said these were additional services the supplier had been willing to 
provide to her. Unhappy with the response, Miss C asked this service to consider the 
complaint.
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint, and concluded that Miss C had purchased 
the alarm specifically because of the monitoring service and that if this hadn’t formed a key 
part of the agreement she wouldn’t have done so. 
The adjudicator recommended that the firm should refund all the payments Miss C would 
have been due to pay to her loan after March 2011, which was when the supplier ceased to 
trade.
The firm didn’t respond to our adjudicator and the complaint was referred for an 
ombudsman’s decision.
 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I’ve reached much the same conclusion as the adjudicator and for largely 
the same reasons.
The promotional material provided to Miss C at the time of the sale clearly shows the 
monitoring and maintenance service as a principal selling point, and I’m satisfied that Miss C 
wouldn’t have purchased the alarm hadn’t she been persuaded that this service formed part 
of the agreement.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8493980
--------------------------

2
Unfortunately, the supplier hasn’t been able to honour the agreement it had with Miss C, due 
to its financial position. 
When a purchase is made with the assistance of credit, the Consumer Credit Act says the 
creditor can be liable for a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier if, 
amongst other things, the supplier is insolvent. 
On this occasion it is, so I’m satisfied the firm can be held liable for the failure of the supplier 
either to properly explain the agreement it was making with Miss C, or to carry out the 
agreement in full.
Miss C was provided with the service she had paid for from the date of purchase in February 
2009 until March 2011, so I think it’s fair for her to pay for that. 
However, I don’t think she should be asked to pay the full amount she agreed with the 
supplier, taking into account the costs of the finance provided to her. 
For these reasons, I’m going to uphold the complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint.
To put things right for Miss C, I now require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:-

Make a payment of £5,136.06 to cover the amount paid by Miss C over and above 
the cost of the 25 months of service she received.

Make a payment to cover interest at 8% simple of £5,136.06, from March 2011 to the 
date of settlement.
The firm should deduct basic rate tax from the interest element of my award and provide 
Miss C with a certificate of tax deduction so they can claim a refund, if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 June 2015.

complaint
Mr A complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited was irresponsible in lending him 
£25,000.
background
In January 2009, Creation lent Mr A £25,000. Mr A says that although he asked for this loan, 
a responsible lender would not have given it to him and that he has only been able to make 
the repayments because he has borrowed money to do this. Mr A says he is in financial 
difficulties and over half of his household debt has been provided to him by Creation. Mr A 
also has debt outstanding on his credit cards and this is being dealt with separately.
Creation says that, before providing a loan, it carries out checks to check a customer’s 
eligibility. These include questions about the customer’s employment status and income. It 
says that in Mr A’s case, because he had previously had a finance arrangement with it, 
information about how this arrangement had been managed was also taken into account. It 
says that based on its checks, and because Mr A settled his finance arrangement in full in 
2011 and that it had always remained within its terms and conditions, it was able to provide 
Mr A with a loan. 
Creation says that it understood that the loan was for Mr A to consolidate other debt and that 
the payments due under the loan were made from the start, February 2009, up until 
July 2013. It says it has only recently been made aware of Mr A’s financial difficulties and 
has requested he complete an income and expenditure form so it can assess a suitable 
temporary repayment plan.
The adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. He said that because Mr A had been able to 
make the repayments for the first four years of the loan, he did not consider that Creation 
had lent irresponsibly. When told about Mr A’s financial difficulties, Creation asked him to 
complete and income and expenditure statement. The adjudicator said this showed it had 
acted positively and sympathetically to Mr A.
Mr A did not agree. He says that Creation has provided him excessive amounts of debt. He 
says that just because debt is asked for it should not always be provided and that in his case 
he was lent to irresponsibly. He has also said, since the adjudicator wrote to him, that he 
sent Creation his income and expenditure statement but after almost two months he has not 
had a response.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In deciding whether Creation lent irresponsibly to Mr A, I have considered whether, at the 
time the loan was made in 2009, the loan was affordable. Before the loan was provided, 
checks were carried out to assess Mr A’s eligibility for the loan. Creation has provided 
evidence of the questions it would ask including those about a customer’s employment 
status and income. These questions help the lender to decide what amount of loan, if any, 
would be affordable. In addition to this information, Creation relied on its past experience 
with Mr A, as he had previously had a finance arrangement with it which he had repaid in 
full. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8539673
--------------------------

2
The loan agreement also clearly sets out the repayment terms and Mr A had the opportunity 
to discuss any concerns he had about repayment before signing the agreement. Because I 
accept that Creation carried out its usual checks on Mr A’s eligibility for the loan and Mr A 
did not mention any repayment concerns at the time, I do not find that Creation lent 
irresponsibly.
If the loan was not affordable from the date it was provided, I would expect Mr A to struggle 
to make the repayments. The evidence shows that Mr A made all the repayments on the 
loan until July 2013 without raising any concerns with the lender. This was more than four 
years after the loan was provided. In August 2013, a repayment was returned and it was 
only after this time that Creation was aware of Mr A’s financial difficulties. I understand that 
Mr A has said that he had to borrow money to make these repayments but I have not seen 
anything to demonstrate this.
Mr A says that the amount of debt Creation has provided him is excessive and I accept that 
this one lender accounts for a large part of Mr A’s household debt. But, given that the loan 
was provided to consolidate a previous debt and I find that the repayments were affordable, 
I do not find that Creation has done anything wrong.
Mr A told Creation about his financial difficulties in 2013. When dealing with customers in 
financial difficulties, lenders are expected to treat customers positively and sympathetically. 
Creation has asked Mr A to complete an income and expenditure statement so that it can 
assess whether a temporary repayment plan can be put in place. I understand that Mr A has 
provided this but that Creation has not responded to him. I understand his frustration as I 
accept that Mr A wants to find a solution to repay his debt. I would expect Creation to 
respond to him about his income and expenditure information and if this does not happen, 
Mr A could raise a separate complaint.  
I also am aware that while this complaint has been investigated, Mr A received letters about 
a potential county court judgement against him. While Creation is not required to stop its 
debt recovery while a complaint is being investigated, I understand that it has confirmed that 
it has put this on hold until the outcome of this case is decided.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.

complaint
Mr J complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) mis-sold him a regular 
monthly premium Payment Protection Insurance (“PPI”) policy when he took out an 
unsecured loan in September 2009. He complains that he was not given sufficient 
information about the terms of the insurance to inform his purchasing decision.
my findings
I have carefully considered all of the available evidence and arguments from the outset, 
in order to decide what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances in accordance with our 
general approach to considering complaints about the mis-sale of PPI, which is well 
documented. I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good 
industry practice at the time the policy was sold. 
In essence, the questions I need to consider are:

if any advice or recommendation was given, whether the product was suitable for Mr J’s 
needs; and

whether Creation gave Mr J information that was clear, fair and not misleading in order to 
put him in a position where he could make an informed choice about the insurance he 
was buying.
If I conclude that there were shortcomings in either of the above, this will not necessarily 
result in me finding in favour of Mr J. I would also need to find that Mr J had acted differently 
– and to his detriment – as a result.
Mr J applied for his loan and insurance via a telephone call. Creation has provided us with a 
recording of that call. Mr J cannot remember whether Creation gave him advice on the 
suitability of the PPI policy – Creation says that it did not. From listening to the call, it is clear 
that Creation did not provide any advice or a recommendation to Mr J.
Creation therefore did not need to ensure the policy was suitable for Mr J’s needs – that was 
essentially a decision he needed to make for himself. Creation was however responsible for 
ensuring that it gave Mr J clear, fair and not misleading information on which he could base 
his purchasing decision.
On the call, Mr J was clearly given the option of taking the loan either with or without the 
insurance. He considered the matter, initially deciding to reject the cover, but then after 
simply being asked to consider what other cover he might have, he opted to add the cover. 
Later, when completing his loan agreement, he again had the option to reject the cover. 
The loan agreement was drawn up to show him the cost of the loan without PPI. Only at the 
end of the agreement, when he was asked to indicate he wanted the policy, did the cost of 
PPI get added into his monthly repayments.
I am therefore persuaded that Mr J was made aware that taking the policy was optional, 
he actively chose to add the cover, and he did not do so as a result of undue pressure being 
applied to him by Creation.
Mr J would be aged between 18 and 65 when the loan was due to be repaid, and at the time 
of the sale, was living in the United Kingdom and working for at least 16 hours per week.

It therefore appears that he was eligible for the cover provided by the policy. He has told us 
that he was not suffering from any pre-existing medical conditions and he did not have any 
indication of impending unemployment and so he would not appear to have been affected by 
any of the significant limitations or exclusions of the policy.
The main features of the policy were described to Mr J during the telephone call. 
Creation tells us that Mr J would then have been sent a full copy of the policy with his loan 
agreement, though I cannot be certain that Mr J received, or read, this posted information. 
Although the telephone description of the policy was somewhat rushed, it covered the main 
benefits and exclusions of the policy and could have provided Mr J with sufficient information 
to make his purchasing decision. However, even if I were to find that the speed of the 
delivery meant Mr J had not received sufficient information, I do not consider a failure in this 
regard would have made Mr J act differently. The information simply explained to him that 
the policy benefits were competitive in the market, he wasn’t affected by any of the main 
limitations or exclusions and that the policy might have been useful to him.
The cost of the policy was clearly given to Mr J on the telephone call, where Creation 
provided him with both the monthly cost and then calculated for him what this would amount 
to over the full 60 months of the loan. Additionally this monthly cost was then shown to Mr J 
on the credit agreement he signed where the monthly cost of the insurance and monthly 
repayment amounts with and without the cover were shown.
In summary, while appreciating that with the benefit of experience and hindsight Mr J might 
not make the same decisions about purchasing the insurance today, I am not persuaded that 
the policy was mis-sold by Creation. The policy was suitable for his financial situation, 
he was made aware of the full cost and he was not disadvantaged by any of the conditions 
or limitations of the policy. As such I am satisfied that Mr J would not have made a different 
decision about purchasing the policy even if he had been presented with clearer or more 
transparent information by Creation.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold the complaint or make any award against 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.

complaint
Mr N complains that the carpets provided to him under a finance agreement with Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd weren’t satisfactory and that not all of the carpets were delivered. 
He’d like to reject the carpets and cancel the agreement.
background
Mr N entered into a finance agreement with Creation in October 2016 for the purchase of 
some carpets. Mr N says, on delivery day, one of the carpets wasn’t delivered and the ones 
that were delivered had problems with their fitting. He says he asked the retailer numerous 
times to resolve the problem but despite two home visits the issues remain and the “missing” 
carpet has still not been delivered.
Mr N says he tried to make a s75 complaint, but Creation didn’t accept it as it considered the 
issue related to the fitting rather than the carpet itself. It told him to go back to the retailer 
about the missing carpet.
Creation also said Mr N wasn’t entitled to bring a s75 claim as while the finance agreement 
was I his name and the order with the retailer was in his wife’s name. As such he couldn’t 
bring a claim regarding the carpet as he hadn’t ordered it.
Our investigator however disagreed and said the purchase was intended for both Mr N and 
his wife and there was sufficient link between them to say they were acting as agents for 
each other in both the order and the finance. This approach was supported by the courts in a 
case Citibank Trust Ltd v Allen [1991] and taking this into account, she felt s75 could apply.
In this case the order hadn’t been fulfilled and as the provider of the finance, Creation was 
jointly liable for this. In view of the time that had passed since the carpets were ordered - and 
the time the retailer had had to put matters right- she felt the appropriate outcome was to 
allow Mr N to cancel the finance agreement. She recommended Creation also refund the 
deposit of £350 paid by Mr N and all of the payments he’d made under the agreement 
together with interest at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of repayment. In 
addition it should also arrange to collect the carpets at no cost to Mr N.
Creation disagreed and it had to take this on as s75 clam. However it didn’t agree to uphold 
the claim as it said the issue was with the fitting and as this had been arranged with a third 
party, it wasn’t covered by s75. And it said Mr N hadn’t complained within the first two years 
after purchase and that it wasn’t now possible to take back the carpets as they’d been cut to 
fit.
Mr N accepted much of the recommendation but said the problems had caused him and his 
wife significant inconvenience over the past two years and he felt they should be 
compensated for this as well as for the fact he hadn’t been able to let one of his rooms as 
intended because of the missing carpet.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I’ve decided to uphold Mr 
N’s complaint for the reasons set out below.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8565135
--------------------------

Under s75 Consumer Credit Act 1974 a consumer has the right in certain circumstances to 
claim against the provider of the credit if there’s a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
the supplier of the goods or services. However to do so there has to be a direct relationship 
between the purchase, the supplier and the creditor.  
Mr N and his wife arranged to buy some new carpets with the benefit of a finance agreement 
with Creation. Although the finance agreement was signed by Mr N and the purchase order 
by his wife I’m satisfied this was intended to be a joint purchase for their shared use at the 
property they both lived in. On that basis I consider that there was a sufficiently close link 
between them to say that this was to all intents a joint purchase and on that basis, that when 
there was a problem, Mr N was entitled to bring a claim.
I’ve seen Creation has said that even if that’s the case, the problem is with the fitting not the 
carpet and fitting wasn’t part of the credit arrangement. On that basis it says the claim isn’t 
covered. 
However in this case, I’m not satisfied that the fitting is the issue. It appears that the carpets 
that were delivered weren’t the right size and so couldn’t be fitted adequately. In other words 
the problem occurred before the fitting. And it’s clear that one of the carpets ordered still 
hasn’t been delivered, despite Mr N chasing this up on several occasions. Taken together 
I’m satisfied the carpets supplied weren’t satisfactory and weren’t of the standard Mr N and 
his wife were entitled to expect. For that reason I consider Creation has liability for this under 
s75 CCA.
Looking at the information available, I don’t think it’s reasonable to try and arrange a repair 
or replacement. Mr N’s been in frequent contact with the retailer about the problems since 
shorty after the purchase and there’ve been several efforts to try and resolve the issues, but 
without success. And even if this was done it wouldn’t resolve the question of the missing 
carpet, which has still to be delivered some two years after it was originally ordered. 
Understandably Mr N has now lost confidence in the ability of the retailer to put matters right.
In the circumstances I’ve decided considerate would be reasonable for Creation to allow Mr 
N to cancel his agreement with it and mark it as settled on Mr N’s credit file. As Mr N has 
had issues from the start it should also refund his deposit of £350 and also all of the 
payments made by him under the agreement together with 8% simple interest from the date 
of payment to the date of repayment. Creation will also need to arrange to collect the carpets 
from Mr N’s home at no cost to him.
I’ve seen Mr N considers he should also receive compensation for the inconvenience and for 
the potential loss of rent. But in order to make an award for financial loss I’d need to see 
evidence of that loss and in this case I haven’t done so. And while I can see there has been 
some inconvenience, I consider the remedy above has taken this into account and is 
adequate.

my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr N’s complaint and direct Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited to

cancel the finance agreement taken out by Mr N in April 2016 and to mark it as 
settled on Mr N’s credit file;

repay the £350 deposit paid by Mr N and all payments made under the agreement 
together with interest at 8%simple from the date of payment to the date of 
repayment;

collect the carpets at no cost to Mr N.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2018.

K821x#12
complaint
Miss W complains about a single premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy sold to 
her in early 2008 over the telephone by Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. 
The policy covered a £7,000, seven-year personal loan for debt consolidation. It provided life, 
accident, sickness, unemployment and carer cover. The policy had a five-year term. Miss W 
says she was led to believe she had to take the policy to get the loan. 
background
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint be upheld. She didn’t think Creation had done 
enough to make Miss W aware of the limited refund she would be entitled to if she cancelled 
the policy early. And she also didn’t think Creation had made Miss W properly aware of the 
cost of the policy. The adjudicator didn’t think Miss W would have agreed to buy the policy, in 
her particular circumstances, if she had been given that information. 
Creation disagreed. It said documents were issued to Miss W after she initially agreed to the 
policy during the telephone call. It says the onus was on Miss W to read those documents 
and query anything she didn’t understand. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. In doing so, I have taken into account any 
relevant regulatory rules and guidance, as well as the law and good industry practice when 
the policy was sold.
We’ve been looking at complaints about the sale of PPI for several years now. And we have 
a well-established approach, which is published on our website. I think the relevant 
considerations in this case are materially the same as our published approach. 
Broadly speaking, what I need to consider here is:

whether Creation gave Miss W advice and, if it did, whether it took adequate steps to 
ensure the policy was suitable for her needs; 

whether Creation gave Miss W information which was clear, fair and not misleading so 
she could make an informed choice about the policy she was buying; and

if there were faults with the way Creation sold the policy, whether Miss W is worse off as 
a result (in other words would she have done something different – such as not buy the 
policy – but for any shortcomings?)
did Creation recommend the policy to Miss W?
Creation says this sale took place on a non-advised basis. It hasn’t been able to provide a 
call recording. But it has provided a sales script it says was in use at the time. That script (if it 
was followed) doesn’t suggest advice would have been given. 
Creation has also provided documents it says would have been issued to Miss W 
immediately after the call – including the credit agreement and a key facts document 
containing a policy summary and statement of price. These documents also tend to suggest 
that Creation didn’t give Miss W any specific recommendation. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8580295
--------------------------

2
Miss W can’t remember whether she was given advice. She does remember that the policy 
was sold over the telephone. She says she doesn’t recall any information being given to her 
about the PPI, or the cost of it. She says she was led to believe she had to have the policy to 
get the loan and, as she was consolidating debts, she accepted the policy at the time. 
Based on Miss W’s description of the telephone call – and considered against the content of 
the script Creation has provided – I have some concerns that Miss W may not have realised 
she had a choice about whether to buy the policy. I note that the credit agreement did require 
her to tick and sign for the policy. But I also note that the various signature sections and tick 
boxes have been marked with arrows and “tick box” instructions hand-written in red pen. This 
might suggest Miss W simply ticked and signed where indicated and without being made 
properly aware she had a real choice. However, I don’t need to reach a finding on that, due 
to the failings I have identified and will set out below. 
Overall – based on the available evidence – I’m not persuaded that Creation gave Miss W a 
specific recommendation to buy the policy. This means it didn’t have to take steps to ensure 
it was suitable for her. But it did have to give her enough information to allow her to make an 
informed choice about the policy she was buying. 
did Creation give Miss W enough information – and did it make a difference if not?
I find that Creation failed to properly bring to Miss W’s attention that the policy didn’t offer a 
pro-rata refund if it was cancelled early – and that it failed to properly disclose the cost of the 
policy. I also find that this was important information which would have impacted on Miss W’s 
decision to buy the policy if she had been made properly aware of it. 
When explaining why I’ve come to my findings it’s important to consider the type of policy 
Miss W bought, and also the context in which she bought it. 
This was a single premium PPI policy. Single premium PPI policies are paid for in a very 
different way to most other insurance products. In particular, their cost structure is different – 
because the initial premium cost is often significantly increased by the interest added to it 
over the term of the loan. 
The fact that the single premium (and the interest on it) is added to the loan up front – and 
then paid back gradually over the term of the loan – means they often also have restrictive 
cancellation terms. Overall, this is not a straightforward way to pay for insurance and can 
lead to significant cost if cancelled early. This is not something Miss W was likely to have 
much understanding of. 
The single premium cost of the policy sold to Miss W was £1,873. A further £1,168 of interest 
added to the premium over the loan term brought the total cost of the PPI to £3,041. Miss W 
had telephoned Creation to apply for a £7,000 loan for debt consolidation. And she was 
taking it over a long period of time – seven years. There was a high likelihood that she would 
look to re-finance the loan again at some point during that period. So the impact of the policy 
cancellation provisions on her ability to refinance the loan – and what it might cost her to do 
so – was important information. Creation should have drawn Miss W’s attention to this. 
As there’s no call recording, I can’t be sure what Miss W was told during the telephone call. If 
I assume the script was followed I can see that it required the call handler to tell Miss W she 
had a statutory right to cancel the policy for up to 30 days after the agreement started, at no 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8580295
--------------------------

3
cost. The script then required the call handler to explain what would happen if Miss W 
cancelled outside that 30-day period. 
However, according to the script, Miss W would only have been told that she would “..only be 
entitled to a partial refund of the original premium”. There was no explanation of how that 
refund would be calculated, or what it might amount to. And there was no explanation that 
the ‘partial refund’ wouldn’t be calculated on a pro-rata basis (as Miss W might otherwise 
reasonably have expected). So the information disclosed in the call script wasn’t enough to 
adequately draw Miss W’s attention to the restrictive cancellation terms. 
The script does indicate that Miss W would have been told to read the policy terms and 
conditions for details of cancellation rights. And Creation says documents were sent to 
Miss W for further clarification after she expressed ‘initial’ interest over the phone. But that’s 
my concern here. Miss W effectively agreed to have the policy added to her loan during the 
phone call. It’s reasonable to conclude that she would place greater reliance on what she 
was told during that call than on anything she received in writing afterwards. 
It is during the call that Creation should have drawn Miss W’s attention to the significant 
features of the policy, including the restrictive nature of the cancellation terms. Sending 
written information afterwards wasn’t enough to mitigate Creation’s failure to disclose this 
information orally. 
I also note that:

It’s not clear that Miss W ever saw the policy summary, or that it was adequately drawn to 
her attention. Even if she did see it, the refund information was positioned at the bottom 
of the second page; where it could be easily missed. 

The policy summary also only said a ‘partial refund’ would be given. It didn’t explicitly say 
this wouldn’t be a pro-rata refund. And it would have been difficult for Miss W to relate the 
percentage examples given in the summary to her own loan and policy term, to allow her 
to work out how much she might lose in real terms if she cancelled the policy early.

The policy summary referred Miss W to the policy document for further information. Again 
it isn’t clear she received the policy document (or when). But even if she did, the relevant 
information is on pages 17 and 18 of a 25-page document. I don’t consider that to be 
prominently positioned, or adequately brought to Miss W’s attention. 
I also find that Creation failed to adequately disclose the policy cost to Miss W, because:

The script didn’t require the call handler to disclose the PPI single premium, or the 
interest charged on it. It did require the call handler to provide the total cost of the PPI. It 
also required them to give monthly costs with and without PPI. However, Miss W’s 
recollection is that only the cost with PPI was given. This doesn’t leave me with much 
confidence that the script was followed, or that Miss W took away from the call a clear 
understanding of the cost of the policy. 

The credit agreement did disclose the single premium and total cost. But again it didn’t 
show the interest cost as a separate figure. It also didn’t show the monthly cost of the 
PPI, which might have helped Miss W to better understand the cost of it relative to the 
loan she was taking out. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8580295
--------------------------

4

The policy summary did include a statement of price which set out the single premium 
and interest separately. But I’ve already explained that I can’t be sure if, or when, Miss W 
saw this document. And the third page of this document wasn’t where she would expect 
to find important information about the cost of the policy. She would reasonably expect to 
find that information in the credit agreement itself. 
Creation says the onus was on Miss W to review the information given and ask for further 
details if she didn’t understand something. That isn’t correct. It was Creation’s responsibility 
to give Miss W enough information about the main features and benefits of the policy to 
enable her to make an informed choice. For the reasons given above I find it failed to do so 
here. And I find that Miss W wouldn’t have bought the policy, but for Creation’s failings. 
I therefore uphold this complaint. 
fair redress
I find that, if Miss W hadn’t bought the PPI policy, she would still have gone ahead with the 
loan. Therefore she should be put back in the position she would have been in if the 
PPI policy hadn’t been sold. 
The PPI policy had a five-year term so should have ended in 2013. However, I understand 
that the loan is still in place as it wasn’t due to end until 2015. 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should therefore:
A. Restructure the loan (without charge to Miss W) so that:

any outstanding PPI is removed; and

the number and amounts of any future loan repayments (including any interest and 
charges) are the same as they would have been if Miss W had taken out the loan without 
PPI.
B. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Miss W because PPI was added 
to her loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Miss W had taken out the 
loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Miss W actually paid and paying her the difference; 
and

paying Miss W interest (simple, not compound) on each of these amounts at the rate of 
8% a year from the date each payment was made to the date the redress is paid†.
C. Write to Miss W to set out what she still owes and how much she will pay and when as a 
result of (A). This should include the details of the calculations and amounts under (B).
If Miss W wants to use any money she receives to reduce the loan, Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd should allow this. But it cannot require Miss W to reduce the loan to less than it 
would be now had Miss W not bought the PPI policy.

† I understand Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is required to deduct basic rate tax from this 
part of the compensation. Whether Miss W needs to take any further action will depend on 
her financial circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our 
website.
Miss W should refer back to Creation Consumer Finance Ltd if she is unsure of the approach 
it has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know 
more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.

complaint
Mrs M complains about a single premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd sold to her in 2007 over the telephone. The policy provided 
life, accident, sickness and unemployment cover for a two-year loan. Mrs M says she was 
told she had to have the policy to get the loan, but that she didn’t need it.
background
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. She didn’t think Creation had made Mrs M aware she 
had a choice about whether to buy the policy. And she also didn’t think it made the cost 
clear.  
Creation disagreed. It said it gave Mrs M a choice whether to buy the policy and told her 
about her cancellation rights. And it also gave her enough information about the cost to 
make an informed choice.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. And I’ve taken into account any relevant 
regulatory rules and guidance, the law and good industry practice when the policy was sold.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the note on 
our website about our approach to PPI complaints. 
did Mrs M have a real choice about whether to buy the policy?
Creation sold the policy to Mrs M during a telephone call. It hasn’t been able to provide a call 
recording; but it has provided a script it says would have been followed. I’ve considered that 
script along with the documents Creation says it would have sent to Mrs M immediately after 
the call. And I’ve also considered what Mrs M says about how the policy was sold to her. 
I’m not satisfied that Creation made Mrs M aware the policy was optional – and that she 
could choose to buy it, or not – because: 

The script is short. It didn’t require the call handler to clearly explain that the policy was 
optional, or get Mrs M’s explicit consent to add it to her loan. 

The script told the call handler to ‘include quotes with payment protection and without’. 
But it didn’t say what form those quotes should take, how they should be delivered, or 
what prominence should be given to the ‘without’ quote. So this part of the script seems 
to have been open to interpretation by each call handler and I can’t be sure what Mrs M 
was told about the quotes. 

The quotes followed right after a statement that the loan hadn’t yet been approved. And 
Mrs M’s says she remembers being told she had to have the policy to get the loan. 
Considered against the contents of the script, I find Mrs M’s submissions persuasive.

I don’t think the brief mention of cancellation rights in the script was enough to make 
Mrs M aware she had a choice about whether to buy the policy. And I also don’t think it 
would have given her the confidence to cancel the policy where she hadn’t first been 
told it was optional. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8613067
--------------------------

2

Mrs M ticked and signed separately for the PPI on the credit agreement. But, it already 
included the PPI which appeared, by then, to be an integral part of the figures in the 
loan agreement. And the agreement didn’t say what would happen if Mrs M chose not to 
tick and sign for the policy.  

Someone has also hand-written “please tick x2” on the agreement; directing Mrs M to 
tick the box accepting the PPI and also the box confirming she’d received information 
Creation had to give her for a distance sale. I think this would only have reinforced her 
belief that she had to have the policy. 

The ‘policy summary’ contained a statement of price, which said “It is not a requirement 
of your credit agreement…that you purchase Creditcover.” But it isn’t clear whether 
Mrs M saw this document or had it adequately drawn to her attention. Even if she saw it, 
this sentence was the very last piece of information on page two at the bottom of the 
statement of price. It wasn’t in a prominent location and could be easily overlooked.

Creation effectively sold the policy to Mrs M over the phone. I think Mrs M would have 
relied more on what she was told during the call than on anything she received in writing 
afterwards. So Creation should have made the optional nature of the policy clear to 
Mrs M during the telephone call. However, it didn’t do that.   
For all the reasons given above, I find that Creation failed to make clear to Mrs M that she 
had any real choice about whether to buy this policy. This is a significant and fundamental 
failing on Creation’s part and I uphold Mrs M’s complaint for this reason. 
other failings
Given the above, I don’t need to go on to look at any further aspects of the way the policy 
was sold. However, for clarity, I will add that I agree with the adjudicator that Creation also 
didn’t properly disclose the cost of the policy to Mrs M. I say this, briefly, because:

This was a single premium policy; where the initial premium cost was significantly 
increased by the interest added to it over the term of the loan. This wasn’t a 
straightforward way to pay for insurance and not something Mrs M was likely to 
understand. She also wasn’t likely to know that this can be an expensive way of paying 
for cover over the more familiar regular premium policy.

The script didn’t require the call handler to disclose the single premium cost, that 
interest would be charged on it and how much that interest would be, or the total cost. 

The credit agreement didn’t show the policy interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t 
reasonable to expect Mrs M to work out this figure by subtracting the PPI premium from 
the total cost. Particularly as these were only two of several figures on the credit 
agreement and as she hadn’t been told the premium would attract interest.  

I can’t be sure Mrs M saw the policy summary and statement of price. But this was the 
only place where the PPI interest was shown as a separate figure. Nothing in the title of 
this document suggested it would contain important information about the cost of the 
policy. And it didn’t make Mrs M aware that she should look at the second page to find 
out important information about the cost of her policy. That wasn’t a prominent location. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8613067
--------------------------

3
Creation should have made sure Mrs M’s attention was drawn to the important information 
about the policy which would be likely to affect her decision making. I have no reason to 
doubt that the cost of the policy would have been important to Mrs M. And I think that, if 
she’d been clearly told about the cost of the policy, she wouldn’t have bought it. 
fair compensation
If Mrs M hadn’t bought the policy, she would still have gone ahead with the loan. So she 
should be put back in the position she would now be in if the policy hadn’t been sold. 
I understand the loan and policy have both already ended. 
Creation should therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mrs M because PPI was added 
to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mrs M had taken out 
the loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mrs M actually paid and paying her the 
difference; and

paying Mrs M simple interest at the rate of 8% a year from the date each payment 
was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mrs M to set out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation has to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the compensation. 
Whether Mrs M needs to take any further action will depend on her financial circumstances. 
More information about the tax position can be found on our website. 
Mrs M should refer back to Creation if she’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And both 
parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this portion of the compensation.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd to pay Mrs M compensation calculated in accordance with the instructions set 
out above under ‘fair compensation’.

were made for remedial works to be done. But despite these arrangements he says not all 
the work has been completed. He describes E as turning up with the wrong replacement 
windows, failing to keep appointments or making contact to say they were coming on a 
different day to that agreed. And at other times he says E has failed to keep in touch. The 
result he says is he’s lost confidence and wants to be able to arrange for another firm of his 
choosing to complete the repairs. He feels he’s due substantial compensation and a 50% 
reduction in the agreed repayment terms.
Creation told us it had upheld Mr W’s complaint. And it had offered £300 in compensation - 
subsequently increased to £350. But Mr W wouldn’t allow E access to his property to replace 
the damaged units. It felt his demands for compensation were disproportionate.
Mr W wasn’t satisfied with the offer of compensation made and complained to us.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 9 April 2018. Creation has replied 
agreeing with my provisional view. Mr W has responded agreeing with the majority of the 
proposed settlement. But he feels the refund of three monthly payments I suggested - to 
reflect impaired use - should be much greater. He thinks eleven payments should be 
refunded to take account of the length of time the defect has remained.
I thank both parties for their replies and I’ve considered what Mr W has said with regard to 
this aspect. But for the reasons I’ll explain I’m not going to be changing my final decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It’s hard to understand how such a relatively routine matter of replacing some window and 
door units has caused so much difficulty. The evidence I’ve seen suggests the entire 
process has been beset by one problem after another.
In the first instance this appears to have been the fault of E as some of the original units 
were damaged, wrong replacement parts were ordered and not all appointments were met 
as agreed. So I can understand Mr W losing faith and wanting to try and use another 
contractor to complete the work. And it seems when he did relent there was further lack of 
communication. This has led to the work still not being complete - over twelve months after 
initial instalment.
As the provider of finance under a fixed sum loan agreement, Creation is equally responsible 
with E for the satisfactory quality of the goods supplied. And it’s liable for any breach of

contract in just the same way a supplier would be. It’s not in dispute some of the items 
supplied weren’t of satisfactory quality. So the normal approach we would adopt is to try and 
return the consumer to the correct position - replace the faulty items - and award 
compensation if appropriate.
Whilst I don’t apply the law I do take it into account when considering what’s fair and 
reasonable. The Consumer Rights Act 2015 provides that where a consumer allows a 
supplier to repair or replace a faulty item - they are only required to allow one opportunity to 
do so before seeking alternative redress. Mr W gave E such an opportunity - indeed more 
than one - so I think he’s entitled to arrange for a suitable replacement part from another 
supplier.
Whilst Creation isn’t responsible for what might be characterised as poor service of E it is 
responsible if its own actions or failure to act result in distress and inconvenience. Whilst it 
may have been convenient for Creation to require E to put things right that doesn’t absolve it 
of responsibility if this isn’t done. It seems to me Creation should have been far more pro - 
active and taken control when it became clear the issue was not being resolved. There 
seems no reason why it could not have arranged for a different contractor to complete the 
work or agree Mr W could do so. Instead it appears to have deferred to E at every stage 
rather than meet its obligations.
As a result Mr W has suffered delay and added distress and inconvenience which could and 
should have been avoided. I’m aware some of the delay resulted from Mr W refusing to allow 
E access - but by then he’d given it enough opportunities and was entitled to have lost 
confidence. This appears to be confirmed by more delay when he did agree with the 
investigator’s suggestion to permit access - only then for there to be a lack of communication 
from E - again leading to the work not being done.
As to the level of redress I’m unable to agree with either Mr W’s request or the investigator’s 
recommendation that he should have 50% of the loan repayments waived. He’s provided a 
quotation for £148.39 to have the damaged items replaced and fitted. That puts him back to 
the position he would have been in at the start of the agreement. And he’d have had to pay 
the whole contracted amount.
But I acknowledge there’s been some impaired use since January 2017 due to the items not 
being replaced. I think Mr W should be refunded three monthly payments of £63.87 to reflect 
this. I’m aware he thinks he should get a significantly greater refund but I can’t agree. The 
basic contract price was in excess of £4,500 spread over 60 months. The cost of replacing 
and fitting the defective parts is a relatively small proportion of the overall cost - so it can be 
seen the majority of the contract was fulfilled satisfactorily.
A monthly payment relates to the entirety of goods and services supplied under the contract 
and applies for the whole period the agreement is in force. So it wouldn’t be fair and 
reasonable to order a refund which was significantly disproportionate to the level of 
impairment. The purpose of compensation is as a means of restitution - not to punish a 
business. So I think this strikes a fair balance.
I recognize Mr W has experienced distress and inconvenience and I think £350 is an 
appropriate sum to compensate for this.

my final decision
For the reasons given above my final decision is to uphold this complaint.
I’m ordering Creation Consumer Finance Limited to:
1.
Pay £148.39 to Mr W to cover the cost and fitting of replacement items.**
2.
Refund three monthly payments of £63.87 plus 8% simple interest per year from date of 
payment to date of settlement.*
3.
Pay £350 to Mr W in compensation for distress and inconvenience.
*If Creation Consumer Finance Limited deducts tax from the interest, it should send a tax 
deduction certificate to Mr W upon request so he can reclaim the tax, if appropriate.
** Mr W should be aware that any guarantee previously attaching to the replaced items will 
no longer apply as Creation won’t be responsible for the work of the supplier Mr W employs.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 May 2018.

complaint
Mr A complains about an energy product (‘Product B’) which he bought on finance from 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.
background
Mr A says that the salesperson misled him at the point of sale. He says that it told him that 
the income and savings from Product B would cover the monthly finance costs.
Our adjudicator thought Mr A had been misled. In summary, she said that Mr A should be 
able to cancel the agreement and return the product.
Creation disagrees. In summary, it says that no evidence has been provided to show that 
Product B would pay for itself. It says that Mr A was provided with all the relevant 
information.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have listened to several post purchase calls that Mr A had with the supplier, and with our 
adjudicator. After all of this I’m just not sure he really understood what he was signing up to 
at the time of sale. And I think it was the supplier’s responsibility to make sure things were 
clear.
I’m not convinced that the supplier did make things clear here. I don’t think anyone (including 
Mr A) dispute that Product B will probably pay for itself over many years. But Mr A appears 
to have been led to believe that in the short term Product B would cover his monthly 
instalments – effectively making it cost neutral during the finance term. His letter of complaint 
to Creation states this. And his conversations after the sale appear to support this too.
I know the supplier says that based on the estimates Product B wasn’t going to cover the 
instalments during the finance term. But:

Mr A says that he wasn’t shown any estimates of income at the time of sale

the information Creation says Mr A was shown about estimates is unsigned, undated 
and contradicts the figures on the satisfaction note he was given

the supplier has not provided a compelling statement from the salesperson involved to 
convince me that what Mr A is saying isn’t correct
The supplier says that the reason for the discrepancy in the output figures is that Mr A got a 
different size system to the one he originally agreed. But what happened with this isn’t clear 
from the paperwork I’ve seen. I know Mr A was shown the finance agreement because he 
signed it. But there is still an element of doubt about what was provided regarding the 
projected returns.
I don’t think Mr A was prepared to be out of pocket in the short term, even if there were long 
term gains. I believe this is quite clear from his conversations after the sale and his actions in 
Ref:

complaining. Had Mr A been given clear information about the short term situation I don’t 
think he would’ve signed up to purchase Product B.
I know that Mr A signed a satisfaction note after Product B was installed which shows the 
output is estimated and will not cover the monthly finance payments. But as this document 
was signed after the sale and related more to the quality of the installation I am not sure 
Mr A would have looked at it closely on the subject or income.
When Mr A first spoke to the supplier to complain it offered him £500 as a goodwill gesture 
to settle the matter. But my impression is that during the calls the supplier acknowledges that 
things were perhaps not as clear as they could’ve been in relation to some sales 
conversations about extras. The supplier said that there was a ‘certain level of cross 
purposes’. So it seems likely that there could’ve been the same confusion when the returns 
from Product B were discussed.
I also note that while discussing Mr A’s complaint on the phone the supplier favourably 
compares the returns from Product B to interest on a savings account. But I find the 
comparison somewhat misleading. It fails to take into account the clear differences between 
outlaying money to buy a product on finance aiming to generate a profit with investing your 
own capital to earn interest. If this type of conversation was part of the sale then I can see 
why Mr A felt misled.
I accept that the supplier has said that these products provide long term benefits. And Mr A’s 
product does appear to be generating income and energy savings. But in this case (and in 
the absence of compelling evidence from the supplier’s point of sale materials) I think it’s 
likely the supplier misled Mr A about the short term benefits.
Mr A has received some savings from the product. Our adjudicator has looked at his energy 
bills and calculated them to be around £427 up to the 14 June 2016 and 74p a day beyond 
that. I have taken a look at her calculations and they look reasonable to me. So Mr A should 
have a deduction from any refund to take into account this and the £87 income payment he 
has received.
my final decision
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:

cancel the finance agreement with no further liability for Mr A and remove any 
information about it from his credit file;

remove Product B and make right any damage caused by the removal at no cost to 
Mr A; and

refund Mr A his payments (if any) after it has deducted the £87 income payment he has 
received, and the approximate energy savings he has made of £427 plus 74p a day 
calculated from 14 June 2016 to the date of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2016.

complaint
Mr C complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd wrongly recorded his wife’s loan as 
being his borrowing.
background
Mr C had some loans with Creation, which he decided to repay. In the course of arranging 
this it became apparent that Creation had wrongly recorded a loan which Mrs C had taken in 
her sole name as being Mr C’s loan. Creation had also reported on the loan for credit 
reference purposes in his name, rather than in Mrs C’s.
Mr C says that this error caused him inconvenience. He also says that it meant his borrowing 
since 2009, with Creation and other lenders, has been at higher interest rates than should 
have been the case – because lenders would have based their rates on a falsely inflated 
figure for his overall borrowing.  
Creation accepted that wrong personal information had been put on Mr C’s loan. It 
apologised and arranged for the loan and credit reference information to be updated. It also 
paid Mr C £75 in respect of the error.
As things were not settled, Mr C brought his complaint to this service where an adjudicator 
investigated it. From the evidence, the adjudicator did not feel there was evidence to show 
that Mr C’s borrowing rates had been higher as a result of the error. Given that Creation had 
put the error right and the loans had been repaid as planned, the adjudicator did not 
recommend that Creation should do more. 
Mr C did not agree and asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman – as he 
was entitled to do.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It’s not in dispute that Creation made a mistake. It’s since put that right but Mr C feels that, 
during the time the error was ongoing, he was disadvantaged by having Mrs C’s loan 
wrongly reported in his name.
Mr C did not experience any difficulty getting credit during the period. However, his view is 
that – but for the wrong reporting – he would have got better interest rates. The difficulty, 
though, is that there’s no firm evidence to support that or to demonstrate what lower rates he 
would have been given. 
I can understand why Mr C is so concerned about what happened. But I do not regulate 
Creation or supervise its data handling, and I have no power to fine Creation. I do not 
consider that I can fairly award compensation for interest rate losses, because there is 
insufficient supporting evidence of that. 
Taking everything into account, I find that Creation has already done enough to settle this 
complaint fairly.

complaint
Ms C complains that furniture she bought with a loan from Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited is of unsatisfactory quality and unfit for purpose.
She brings this complaint against Creation under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974.
background
Ms C bought a sofa and some other furniture (as part of a set) from a third party (that I’ll call 
D) in May 2017. She got a loan from Creation to fund the purchase. She thinks the sofa is 
uncomfortable and not fit for purpose. D carried out some remedial work but this didn’t help. 
So Ms C arranged for an expert to inspect in September 2017. He found the sofa has a 
number of manufacturing faults.
Creation and D didn’t accept those conclusions. They instructed a second expert and he 
says the issues are probably wear and tear related. Ms C was unhappy with that and she 
brought her complaint to this service.
Our investigator thought it might help to get a view from another independent expert. The 
parties agreed and a third expert was instructed. He says the sofa is faulty but D and 
Creation don’t accept his findings.
Our investigator thinks the weight of the evidence suggests this sofa probably has 
manufacturing defects. He considers it is likely to have been of unsatisfactory quality when 
Ms C got it and recommends the complaint should be upheld.
The sofa is part of a matching set so our investigator says Creation should arrange to take 
that back, cancel the finance and mark the loan as settled on Ms C’s credit file. He considers 
Creation should also refund expert’s fees and the deposit and instalments paid under the 
loan, plus interest. He feels Ms C did her best to sort things out with D and Creation and it’s 
unfair that she’s had to put up with faulty furniture for such a long time. He says Creation 
should pay Ms C £150 compensation for the associated distress and inconvenience.
Creation doesn’t agree. It asked for an ombudsman to review the matter.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I’ve reached much the same conclusions 
as our investigator for broadly the same reasons.
Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 says a lender may be held equally liable with a 
supplier if there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation, in certain circumstances.
D was obliged (under legislation) to ensure that the goods it sold Ms C here were of 
satisfactory quality at the point of sale. Ms C thinks D is in breach of that obligation – as the 
sofa is faulty. So she brings her complaint against Creation under section 75, because it lent 
her the money to pay the furniture.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8673146

My job is to decide what, if anything, Creation should do to resolve this complaint. I’ve 
looked at all of the available evidence and the wider circumstances in order reach what 
I think is a fair and reasonable outcome. And I’ve taken the relevant law (amongst other 
things) including section 75 into account.
I’ve read each of the expert’s reports carefully. I note all of the experts inspected the sofa 
after D had the chance to repair. The first expert says the sofa has multiple manufacturing 
defects that are outside relevant manufacturing tolerances. He thinks these will only get 
worse over time. He finds the sofa is unfit for purpose and repair is not a viable option.
The second expert thinks the issues are more likely to be wear and tear related – but he 
doesn’t explain why, in any great detail. The third expert’s conclusions seem to be much the 
same as those of the first – he says the sofa seats have lost density in excess of 
manufacturing tolerances, the webbing is unsupportive and attempts at repair haven’t 
worked.
When there’s contradictory evidence like this, I reach my decision on the balance of 
probabilities – I decide what I think is most likely taking the available evidence and wider 
circumstances into account.
I find the evidence of the first and third experts to be more compelling than that of the 
second expert, on balance. I consider their explanations about what’s gone wrong make 
sense. And I find their arguments about why these issues are more likely to be due to 
manufacturing faults (rather than wear and tear) to be credible and consistent.
Looking at all of the evidence, I’m satisfied it is more likely than not this sofa was of 
unsatisfactory quality at the point of sale. I think it was reasonable of Ms C to give D to 
chance to fix things – but I’m satisfied those repairs haven’t been successful. I consider it is 
fair and reasonable for Ms C to be allowed to reject the goods now. And I find Creation 
should cancel this loan, arrange for the furniture set to be collected, return the deposit and 
refund any instalments plus interest.
I’m satisfied Ms C only had to instruct experts because the goods were faulty. So I think it is 
fair for Creation to refund any fees she paid, if it hasn’t done so already. I accept Ms C is 
likely to have been upset and inconvenienced as a result of receiving this faulty sofa. And 
I find it is fair and reasonable for Creation to pay her £150 compensation for that.
my final decision
My decision is I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement I require Creation 
Consumer Finance Limited to:
1.
cancel the loan agreement and mark it as settled on Ms C’s credit file;
2.
refund Ms C’s deposit and any repayments she made towards the loan;
3.
refund any expert’s fees Ms C paid (not refunded already);
4.
pay interest on the refunds referred to at 2 and 3 above at 8% simple a year from the 
date of payment to the date of settlement;
5.
arrange for the furniture set to be collected at a mutually convenient time – at no cost to 
Ms C; and
6.
pay Ms C £150 compensation for distress and inconvenience.

K821x#15
complaint
Mrs Y complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited has unfairly rejected her claim 
under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the ‘Act’). Her claim involves some solar 
panels that she thinks were mis-sold to her by the supplier.
background
Mrs Y bought some solar panels from a supplier (“G”) in May 2014. She bought the panels 
for a cost of £6,995 using a point of sale loan provided by Creation. Interest was payable on 
that loan at 9.9% (variable) per year. The total interest payable over the 10 year duration of 
the loan was stated to be £3,856.20 - and the monthly payments were £90.42 - making a 
total payable of £10,851.20.
Mrs Y has said that G’s sales agent told her that the panels would pay for themselves, apart 
from in the winter when there might be a £12 a month shortfall. So she says she was led to 
believe that the electricity generated and the government’s feed in tariff subsidy (‘FIT’) 
should pay off the whole loan and possibly more. So, in effect, the panels would be self-
funding.
The panels are not in fact self-funding and would never have been over the 10 years that the 
loan would be outstanding. There was a shortfall of about £40 a month. Mrs Y made a claim 
against Creation under section 75 of the Act, holding it responsible for G’s 
misrepresentation. She says this induced her into buying the panels, something she says 
that she couldn’t afford and wouldn’t have bought if she thought it was going to cost her what 
has turned out to be over £400 a year.
Creation didn’t agree that the benefits of the panels had been misrepresented. It said that 
the loan agreement was clear as to the amount payable and that there was no evidence that 
G had made the self-funding claims that Mrs Y alleged. It said that at the time of sale Mrs Y 
had been provided with a calculation showing the benefit that the panels would provide and 
that this clearly showed how they would pay for themselves over a 20 year period, not the 10 
years that the loan was for.
Creation have said that Mrs Y signed a form confirming that she had understood her 
personal figures estimate and the finance agreement. Mrs Y says that form was pre-filled for 
her by the sales agent, who’d answered yes to each of the questions on her behalf and that 
she wasn’t shown a personal figures estimate.
Creation have also said that there would have been a follow up call from another of G’s staff 
to confirm that Mrs Y was aware of the finance options available to her and that she wanted 
to go ahead with the purchase and installation. Creation have provided us with a sales script 
for that call, although there is no evidence of the call itself having been made.
Our investigator thought that Mrs Y’s complaint should be upheld. She considered that G 
had more likely than not misrepresented the benefits of the panels to Mrs Y. So, she thought 
Creation were equally responsible with G under Section 75 of the Act for that 
misrepresentation. She recommended that Creation either repay the overpayments that 
Mrs Y had made, on the assumption that the panels would have been self-funding and/or re-
write the loan agreement to make future repayments self-funding.

Mrs Y accepted the investigator’s recommendation, but Creation didn’t agree. So the matter 
has come to me for a decision
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering Mrs Y’s complaint, I must determine what’s more likely than not to have 
happened when she decided to buy the solar panels. If I find that G misled Mrs Y into 
thinking that the panels would be self-funding, and that she wouldn’t have entered into the 
agreement that she did, but for that misrepresentation, then Creation will be equally liable 
with G under Section 75 of the Act.
Mrs Y tells us she had been considering a roof-rental scheme with a couple of other solar 
panel providers when she was approached by G. So buying these panels on a finance 
arrangement isn’t something that I think Mrs Y was looking to do, regardless of whether or 
not there was a cost to her to purchase them. I consider that she will have been reliant on 
G’s sales agent to fully explain to her the benefit of purchasing the panels and the cost to her 
of installing them.
Mrs Y has told us that the sales agent misled her into thinking that the panels would be self-
funding. The only documentation available to confirm what was discussed is a sales 
confirmation form, a checklist of questions signed by Mrs Y, a post-installation customer 
satisfaction note and the credit agreement. Creation have also provided us with a copy of a 
personal figures projection which it says would have been provided to Mrs Y at the time of 
sale.
I’ve looked carefully through each of these documents. The sales confirmation form doesn’t 
give any indication about the savings to be achieved. And Mrs Y says that she didn’t receive 
the personal figures projection at the time. I can’t be sure whether or not she did receive that 
personal projection from the sales agent. But, even if she had, whilst it was clear that the 
panels were estimated to produce about £680 of income a year, the projection only 
compares the financial returns to the cost of the panels themselves (£6,995) and not the 
finance costs including interest (£10,851.20). So even if she had seen it, I don’t think it would 
have been clear to her that the panels weren’t self-funding.
The personal figures projection indicates that the panels will be paid back over 9 years. That 
may have been true if the panels had been purchased outright and not on finance. Indeed, 
the performance of the panels has been similar to the predictions. But this has still left Mrs Y 
nearly £400 a year short in meeting the finance costs. And that’s because of the interest on 
the loan which wasn’t accounted for in the projection. 
Creation thinks that should have been obvious to Mrs Y, but I don’t think it would have been. 
9 years is called out as the payback period and the form indicates that Mrs Y will have a 
9.7% tax free return in the first year. Given the interest on the loan, that was never going to 
happen. So even if Mrs Y did get a copy of this personal projection, it’s my finding that it was 
misleading.
Mrs Y has told us that she remembers the sales discussion. And that G’s sales agent was 
very clear that there would be no cost to her in the summer - and that in the winter it wouldn’t 
be more than £12 a month shortfall - which would be recouped in the summer months’

generation. Mrs Y has also told us that she explained her financial position to the agent at 
the time and that there was no way she would be able to afford these if they weren’t self-
funding.
I have no reason to doubt Mrs Y’s recollection of the events, which are in part backed up by 
the written evidence available, in particular the personal figures projection figures which 
shows the panels paying for themselves over nine years, a shorter period than the ten year 
loan.
I’ve also looked at the checklist of questions that Creation thinks shows Mrs Y confirmed she 
was happy with the terms of the transaction. Mrs Y says that the checklist that she signed on 
the day of the sale was pre-filled by the sales agent. It’s my finding that that is likely, given 
that the answers are all ‘Yes’ in the same handwriting. One of those questions was:
‘At this stage are there any questions that you feel you need clarification on?’ 
That question was answered ‘Yes’ too, rather than being filled in with any additional 
questions that Mrs Y had. And Mrs Y tells us there was nothing else she needed to know at 
the time. So this does say to me that the form was more likely than not to have been filled 
out by someone very quickly and not very carefully. So I don’t think it provides any 
persuasive evidence that Mrs Y had understood everything about the loan agreement and 
the personal projection as Creation alleges.
The post-installation customer satisfaction note is clear on the amount of savings that Mrs Y 
is likely to have made (£680 a year) and it does appear to have been signed by her. But as 
there is no mention of the finance costs on there, it wouldn’t have been apparent to Mrs Y 
that the benefits wouldn’t meet the burden of the finance agreement. It was also provided 
after the sale and the installation. So it would have been of limited value in explaining things 
for Mrs Y when the panels were already up on the roof.
The final document was the credit agreement and whilst that’s clear as to the cost of the 
loan, there is understandably nothing on it that compares the estimated benefit from the 
panels with the monthly payment that will become due. So Mrs Y would have had to 
compare all the documents she received to work out that the panels would not be self-
funding. There was nothing clearly setting out the cost to her for the duration of the loan and 
Mrs Y has told us that she was assured by G’s sales agent that the panels would be self-
funding. So I can appreciate why she wouldn’t have felt the need to look at these closely.
Creation has said that it thinks that there was nothing wrong with G’s sale of the panels and 
that the misrepresentation didn’t happen. It thinks that Mrs Y only came to allege they were 
mis-sold when she got into financial difficulty a couple of years later and could no longer 
afford them. I’ve considered this. Mrs Y’s explanation as to why she didn’t bring a complaint 
any earlier was that she could only put the performance information together after 21 
months. So she didn’t know how much she was saving overall before then.
I can appreciate that it will have taken some time for Mrs Y to be able to work out the extent 
of the benefit that she was achieving from the panels. And it’s not unreasonable for her to 
have needed a couple of years’ figures before she was able to see that the panels weren’t 
effectively paying for themselves. Whilst Mrs Y might have been in financial difficulty at the 
time that she made her complaint, I don’t think that outweighs the evidence indicating that 
Mrs Y was more likely than not told by G’s sales agent that the panels and the loan would be 
self-funding.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8720692

Finally, Creation has provided us with a sales script where G’s agent would have run through 
the cost of the panels and the loan and warned that the interest on the loan would mean that 
there would be more to pay than the panels generated. But there’s no evidence that such a 
call took place or that Mrs Y will have received the warning in the terms scripted. So I 
haven’t found that there’s sufficient evidence to say that she more likely than not was given 
these warnings.
So, it’s my overall finding that Mrs Y was more likely than not misled by G’s sales agent into 
thinking that the panels would be self-funding. Creation is equally liable with G for that 
misrepresentation under the terms of Section 75 of the Act. And I don’t consider that Mrs Y 
would have entered into the purchase and finance agreements on the terms that she did had 
she known it would cost her around £400 a year more than the income/savings from the 
panels.
fair compensation
I’ve considered what would be fair compensation in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having found that there was a misrepresentation, I might have considered putting the parties 
back into the position that they would have been in but for the misrepresentation. So here 
that would mean looking at whether or not Mrs Y would have taken out the panels but for 
that misrepresentation. And if she wouldn’t, then looking to unwind the transaction entirely.
However, I don’t think that would be a fair thing to require of Creation in the circumstances of 
this complaint. Given that the panels are still working and producing electricity, and Mrs Y 
doesn’t appear unhappy with them, other than that they’re not currently paying for 
themselves, I don’t think it would be fair here to require Creation to remove the panels and 
wind back the finance agreement. 
Mrs Y has clearly had some significant benefits from these panels over the years and 
continues to do so. Given that the parties are now over half way through the 10 year 
agreement, I consider a fair and reasonable approach in this case would be to require 
Creation to calculate how much of the loan has been, and will be, self-funded by the 
electricity generated from the panels and the FIT payments. It should then refund to Mrs Y 
what she has effectively overpaid for the loan above that, together with interest at 8% simple 
a year to reflect the time that she hasn’t had the use of that money. It should also restructure 
the loan to ensure that it is self-funding going forward.
How the overpayments are to be used can be structured in a number of ways and I have set 
these out in my award below. Mrs Y should choose which she would prefer when letting us 
know if she accepts my decision. It would be helpful if Creation could please provide Mrs Y 
and this service with the figures for each of the proposed arrangements so that she can 
make an informed decision about which would be best for her.
I also think that Mrs Y will have been upset and inconvenienced by Creation’s failure to 
accept her claim when she made it. For that I think it should pay her £100 compensation.
my final decision
It’s my final decision that I uphold this complaint against Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8720692

I require that Creation Consumer Finance Limited:
1.
restructures the loan to ensure that it is self-funding from the electricity generated 
and the FIT payments;
2.
does one of the following, when Mrs Y communicates her choice of remedy, in 
relation to the overpayments that she has made. In calculating those overpayments, 
Creation should add interest* at 8% simple a year from the time that Mrs Y made the 
payments to the time that they’re applied to her account or are refunded.
a) use the overpayments to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan so that Mrs Y
continues to make her current monthly payment resulting in the loan finishing early;
b) use the overpayments to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan so that Mrs Y 
pays a new monthly payment until the end of the original loan term;
c) refund the overpayments to Mrs Y and she continues to make her current
monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early; or
d) return the overpayments to Mrs Y and she pays a new monthly payment
until the end of the original loan term; and
3.
 pays Mrs Y £100 for the upset and inconvenience caused to her.
* Her Majesty’s Revenue and customs requires that Creation take off income tax from any 
interest paid. If Mrs Y requests it, Creation should provide her with a certificate showing how 
much tax it has taken off, so that she can reclaim it if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 January 2020.

complaint
Mr B complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (the business) is charging him for 
furniture which was not delivered because he cancelled the order. 
background
Mr B placed an order with a supplier on 24 September for a number of items. He financed 
this through a fixed sum loan agreement with the business.
Mr B emailed the supplier on 1 November to say he no longer wanted a number of the items 
he had ordered. He says that he was unable to view them in store and so was relying on the 
supplier’s terms which noted that the consumer regulations applied if the goods were not 
custom made or if they had not been able to be viewed in store. He says he cancelled before 
delivery was made.
Mr B says that the business started to take his direct debit payments even though the 
agreement stated these would not be taken until the goods had been supplied. He says that 
the supplier told the business that the goods had been delivered when this was not true as 
only one item had been delivered and the rest had been cancelled.
Mr B says that a late payment marker was also unfairly added to his credit file and that he 
has sent letters to the business but he has not received a response.
The business says that the supplier says Mr B’s furniture was made in a particular way to 
meet his request and was not cancelled until the day the items were delivered to its store. It 
says the supplier has offered to cancel the items on payment of a cancellation fee.
The business further says that the supplier confirmed that the terms and conditions Mr B 
quoted related to on-line orders and that for in-store orders customers are advised that the 
order is non-cancellable and once signed is legally binding. It says that the supplier has told 
Mr B that he should pay a cancellation fee plus the amount due for the item he did take 
delivery of plus the associated delivery charge. It says once this happens the supplier will 
cancel the finance agreement.
The business agreed to remove the late payment marker from Mr B’s credit file.
The investigator did not uphold this complaint. He did not find that there had been a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation and so did not require the business to take any further 
action. He said that the supplier had said it was willing to cancel the contract upon receipt of 
a cancellation fee, plus the cost of the coffee table and delivery. He said that once this 
happened the business said it would cancel the finance agreement and refund any 
payments made. The investigator said that if Mr B wished to accept this he should contact 
the supplier directly.
Mr B did not accept the investigator’s view. He said that the supplier’s terms and conditions 
stated that he could cancel as he had not seen the products in the showroom. He said that 
the business should not have taken direct debit payments as the delivery had not occurred 
(apart from the coffee table).

my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This complaint is against the business and my role is to decide whether or not the business 
has done anything wrong, and if so, what it is required to do to put this right. 
In this case Mr B ordered some furniture items in the supplier’s store. He financed his 
acquisition through a fixed sum loan agreement with the business. Because the acquisition 
was financed through a loan agreement, the business is liable in certain situations.
Mr B decided to cancel a number of the items before they were delivered to him. This was 
not due to any concerns about the quality of the goods and I do not find that there is any 
suggestion that the goods were misrepresented to him. Mr B chose to cancel part of his 
order as he decided after placing the order the items would be unsuitable for him.
The supplier has agreed to allow the cancellation however it has said a cancellation fee will 
need to be paid.
In this situation, as I do not find evidence of a misrepresentation, I find the business would 
only be liable if there had been a breach of contract. Mr B says that there has been a breach 
and has quoted the cancellation policy on the supplier’s website. I have looked at the 
website and this sets out:
‘Welcome to the.. website terms and conditions for use. These apply to the use of this 
Website and by accessing this Website and/or placing an order through the Head Office 
Telephone Sales Department, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set out 
below”
The supplier has said that these terms relate to orders placed through the website and 
telephone orders. Based on the information above I accept this.
I also note that on the website the cancelation policy notes that the consumer contract 
regulations only apply if the goods have not been custom made or not been examined in one 
of the showrooms. I understand Mr B’s comment about the showroom but I also accept that 
the goods were made to his specification.
Mr B was provided with a sales contract when he placed his order which he signed. This 
states:
“the goods in this order are made for you and to your specifications. It is important that you 
understand this order is a legally binding contract”
Based on the above, I find it reasonable to accept that Mr B should have been aware that he 
would be bound by the contract once the order had been placed. Mr B cancelled his order a 
number of weeks after he placed it and while I can see the items had not been delivered to 
him at that time, I accept that the supplier had made the items and I understand they were 
delivered to the store. Based on this I do not find that I can say the supplier breached the 
contract by charging a cancellation fee.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8825256
--------------------------

3
Mr B has also complained that the business started to take his direct debit payment before 
all the items were delivered. I can see why this was frustrating for Mr B. I have listened to the 
call when Mr B raised this issue with the business and note that he was told that a 
satisfaction notice had been received and that it had not received a cancelation notice. 
Based on this I do not find it unreasonable that the business said payments would be taken. 
I note on the call the payment date was put back to allow time for Mr B to contact the 
supplier about this issue. The business has since said that the account would not normally 
be put on hold when there is not an issue with the goods but the customer has changed their 
mind.
On balance, while I note Mr B’s comments I do not find it unreasonable that the business 
started to take his payments. The finance agreement had been set up and the items made 
and while only one was delivered to Mr B, the others were available for delivery. The 
business has said that once Mr B pays the cancelation fee and costs associated with the 
item that was delivered it will cancel his finance agreement and refund his payments. I find 
this reasonable.
Mr B said that his letters were not answered by the business. I can see that a final response 
letter was sent in December 2016. However I note that Mr B has sent further letters since 
this date. Mr B has been told that this should be raised as a separate complaint and so I 
have not addressed this point further. 
If Mr B wishes to accept the supplier’s offer he should contact it directly.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2017.

complaint
Mr T is unhappy with the amount of time it took Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to cancel a 
credit agreement and the way it dealt with his enquiries.
background
Mr T borrowed money from Creation to buy an item of furniture, which he ended up returning 
to the retailer. He says Creation took too long cancelling the debt and returning his 
repayments. And, given the considerable amount of time he had to spend chasing Creation, 
he didn’t feel its offer of compensation was sufficient.
After the complaint came to us Creation offered to pay a further £50 compensation to Mr T. It 
said it had already paid £50 in recognition of the delays in refunding Mr T’s money, not 
calling him back when it said it would and to cover his call costs. And the extra £50 was in 
recognition of the delay paying the earlier compensation, between July and September 
2018.
Our investigator thought Creation’s offer was fair. But Mr T disagreed and asked for his 
complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
From what I’ve seen, all the money Mr T paid Creation has now been returned to him. So 
what remains for me to decide is how much compensation should be paid.
Mr T says the first £50 compensation had nothing to do with this complaint. But, having 
looked at the various letters Creation sent Mr T last year, I disagree. It seems clear the 
problem with the loan went on for several months and he got in touch with Creation several 
times about this. And the earlier £30 and £20 compensation payments (totalling £50) were 
related to the same issue he asked us to look into.
There’s no dispute that Creation made mistakes and didn’t make the payments it said it 
would as quickly as it should have. And that meant Mr T was out of pocket for longer than he 
should’ve been and had to get in touch with Creation more times than he should’ve had to.  
Mr T also says Creation’s staff weren’t always as helpful and courteous as he expected them 
to be. Creation hasn’t provided us with recordings of those calls. But its letters indicated it 
had listened to some of the calls and says its staff acted professionally, although it also 
accepted latterly that some incorrect information was given.
Taking into account the delays, Creation’s mistakes and the possibility its staff could’ve 
handled some calls better I think £100 compensation in total is a fair and reasonable 
amount. From the evidence I’ve seen it looks like Creation has already paid this amount to 
Mr T. But if he can show otherwise then Creation should look into this further and ensure any 
missing payments are made promptly.

My final decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd has offered a fair amount of

complaint
Mrs M complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is holding her liable for a loan which 
she says she didn’t take out. And that this has affected her credit file. 
background
On 21 April 2016, £7,500 was paid into Mrs M’s savings account by Creation following a loan 
application. On 22 April 2016, £4,000 was withdrawn from Mrs M’s savings bank account 
using her card at a branch. 
There were further transfers to Mrs M’s current account on 7, 10 15 June 2016. And another 
transfer on 5 July 2016.
Mrs M says she didn’t take out the loan. She says it wasn’t until she received a letter from 
Creation in March 2017, saying that the loan account was in arrears, and that late payments 
had been recorded on her credit file that she realised that the loan had been taken out.
Mrs M complained to Creation. She told them she hadn’t taken out the loan and she’d been 
the victim of fraud. Creation didn’t accept that the loan had been taken fraudulently. It said it 
had sent Mrs M’s letters about the arrears. And that Mrs M had initially made payments 
towards the loan. Mrs M disagreed. So she brought her complaint to this service.
Our investigator didn’t think Mrs M’s complaint should be upheld. She said that the loan had 
been paid into Mrs M’s bank account. And some of the money had been withdrawn using 
Mrs M’s bank card at a branch. She also said that payments were made towards the loan 
from accounts held by Mrs M. So she didn’t think the loan had been taken out fraudulently.
Mrs M disagreed. She said she’s been the victim of fraud and never took out the loan or 
made any payments towards it. As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I’m not upholding this 
complaint for broadly the same reasons as the investigator.
Although this complaint is against Creation, the proceeds from the loan were credited to 
Mrs M’s savings account with Bank A. Mrs M’s debit card was used to withdraw these funds. 
And transfers were made to her current account.
I’ve considered information from Mrs M, Bank A and Creation in order to reach my decision. 
The loan was taken out during a telephone call. Unfortunately, Creation hasn’t been able to 
provide me with a recording of this conversation due to the time that has passed. But it has 
given me a signed copy of the loan agreement dated 13 April 2016. The address details on 
the loan agreement are the same address Mrs M has given us. And it includes the details of 
Mrs M’s savings bank account where the funds were to be paid. So whoever took out the 
loan needed access to Mrs M’s address to sign the agreement, access to Mrs M’s savings 
account and access to Mrs M’s current account because money was transferred to this 
account. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8851034
--------------------------

2
Creation took necessary steps to ensure that the application was sent to Mrs M’s address. 
And the funds were paid to an account in Mrs M’s name. They also carried out the 
necessary checks to ensure the loan was affordable based on the information they were 
told. So I can’t say they did anything wrong when they approved the loan. 
 
Mrs M’s been very clear that she didn’t make any payments towards the loan. But from 
looking at the payment history Creation has provided, I can see that a direct debit was made 
from Mrs M’s bank account in May 2016. I can also see that payments had been made 
towards the loan from two different bank accounts belonging to Mrs M. I’ve been able to 
listen to one of these payment calls made on 13 June 2016, which was before Mrs M notified 
Creation that she didn’t take out the loan. I’ve compared the recording to recordings of 
phone calls we’ve had with Mrs M. Having done so I can’t say the call in June was made by 
someone other than Mrs M.
I’ve been given copies of Mrs M’s statement for her savings and current accounts. And I’ve 
seen a record of both accounts activity. I can see that the loan was paid into Mrs M’s savings 
account on 21 April 2016. And on 22 April 2016 Mrs M’s bank card was used at a branch to 
withdraw £4,000. From looking at the savings account activity report I can see that Mrs M 
checked her online account balance on 15, 18, 20 and 21 April 2016. And further transfers 
were made from the savings account into Mrs M’s current account. I can see that these 
transfers helped Mrs M to pay bills and day to day spending.
Mrs M has told us that she didn’t know anything about the loan until 2017. But having 
considered what Bank A has sent us, I’m satisfied that Mrs M was regularly checking her 
savings and current account. So I’m satisfied Mrs M was monitoring her accounts throughout 
2016. I’ve also taken note that direct debits were paid and a call was made to make an 
additional payment to Creation. So overall I don’t think there is sufficient evidence to say that 
Mrs M didn’t apply for the loan.
I know Mrs M will be disappointed with what I’ve said. But from looking at the evidence I’m 
satisfied that Mrs M has benefitted from the loan. So I don’t believe Creation is doing 
anything wrong in asking Mrs M to repay the loan.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I don’t uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs M to accept or reject my decision before
29 May 2018.

K821x#15
complaint
Mr F is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), following 
a claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
background
Mr F was contacted by a company that supplied and installed solar panel systems. I’ll refer 
to it as ‘R’. Following a meeting, Mr F agreed to enter into a contract with R for it to supply 
and install a solar panel system costing about £10,000. To fund this Mr F also agreed to 
enter into a 10 year fixed sum loan agreement with Creation.
Mr F made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the CCA. He said that R had told him that the 
solar panels would be ‘self-funded’ and that the monthly loan repayments would be more 
than off-set by any benefit he’d receive by way of feed-in-tariff (‘FIT’) income and savings by 
using the electricity generated by the solar panels rather than buying it from his energy 
provider. But that hadn’t happened. Instead, the monthly loan repayments had been much 
higher than any benefits.
In its final response letter, Creation said that it didn’t think the benefits of the solar panels 
had been misrepresented to Mr F. Unhappy with the response; Mr F referred his complaint 
to our service.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. He felt the benefits of the solar 
panel system had been misrepresented to Mr F. He recommended that Creation calculate 
the potential savings and income to Mr F over the term of the loan and then restructure the 
loan so that Mr F didn’t pay any more than this over the 10-year term of the loan. As this 
may have meant that Mr F had overpaid on his loan the investigator recommended Mr F to 
be given the following choice on how he’d like any overpayment to be used:
1.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and Mr F 
continues to pay his existing monthly payment resulting in his loan finishing early,
2.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and Mr F 
pays a new, lower monthly payment until the end of the loan term,
3.
the overpayments are returned to Mr F and he continues to pay his current monthly 
payment resulting in his loan finishing early, or;
4.
the overpayments are returned to Mr F and he pays a new, lower monthly payment 
until the end of the loan term.
Our investigator also recommended that Creation pay Mr F £100 to recognise the trouble 
and upset caused.
Creation accepted the investigators view of the complaint. Mr F also accepted but raised that 
he had to pay for some repair work to be carried out to the system and paid for an additional 
monitoring and warranty. He wanted Creation to consider reimbursing this.
Our investigator passed this information to Creation. Creation said the repair work was due 
to water damage and therefore not covered under warranty supplied by R and that the 
additional warranty and monitoring he’d paid for was a separate transaction and therefore 
not covered under s75.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8938256
--------------------------

As an agreement couldn’t be reached the complaint has been passed to me to review.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr F says that he was cold-called and during a sales meeting told that the solar panels 
would be entirely self-financing. Having carefully considered the available evidence, like the 
investigator, I think that R did misrepresent the benefits of the solar panel system. Creation 
has accepted the investigator’s view and as a result this decision will deal with what I 
consider to be fair compensation.
The role of this service is to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses 
providing financial services fairly and reasonably with minimum formality. In cases like this 
one, determining fair compensation isn’t an exact science. My role is to arrive at a fair and 
reasonable outcome taking account of the particular circumstances.
I’ve considered whether it would be appropriate to put Mr F back into the position he would 
have been in if there had been no misrepresentation. However, here, I don’t think it would be 
fair or proportionate to require the removal of the solar panels from his home. Rather, I think 
the fair outcome here is to put Mr F in a position where the panels are self-funding over the 
original term of the loan. By allowing Mr F to keep the panels, I’m satisfied that he will likely 
benefit from lower electricity bills and FIT payments going forward (i.e. after the term of the 
loan has finished).
I’ve carefully considered the methodology Creation has submitted to this service to calculate 
the total benefits of the solar system. This methodology is based on the actual performance 
and estimated future performance of Mr F’s solar panel system.
I’ve considered the assumptions used by Creation, including the self-consumption rate, 
electricity price inflation, the degradation rate and the estimated retail price index. I’m of the 
view that these appear reasonable taking into account the actual known figures. As an 
example, the actual average retail price index for the last four years doesn’t seem to be far 
from the assumed figure. In summary, I’m satisfied that the assumptions that have been 
used by Creation provide a fair and reasonable basis for calculating fair compensation.
I turn now to the repair costs and additional monitoring and warranty Mr F has taken out. The 
generation meter had to be replaced in December 2016 at a cost of around £320. At the time 
it was replaced by R, it said the meter had been damaged by water dripping from the central 
heating boiler. And because of this it wasn’t covered under the warranty.
I’ve carefully considered the warranty that R supplied Mr F. This is a five year workmanship 
warranty. This means that if there is a fault with Mr F’s solar panel system found during the 
first five years of installation due to poor workmanship it would be covered. There is very 
limited information on what happened when the generation meter was replaced. Mr F has 
provided his testimony that he was told it had suffered water damage but when he asked to 
see the damage, he was told the meter couldn’t be found amongst all the other items in R’s 
van. 
I have no doubt to disbelieve what Mr F has said and find his testimony both plausible and 
persuasive. Having said that, without any contradictory evidence to show that the issue was 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8938256
--------------------------

caused by poor workmanship I’m unable to say it would be fair for Creation to cover the cost 
of it.
R contacted Mr F in November 2018 to let him know that a new company, I’ll refer to them 
as ‘E’, would be honouring any parts that may need replacing under the original term of the 
warranty. E contacted Mr F as it believed there was a fault with his system. When E 
attended Mr F’s home it found the Envoy R that had been originally installed wasn’t working. 
My understanding is that the Envoy R sends information electronically to a central monitoring 
system on the performance of Mr F’s solar panel system.
As the Envoy R was no longer available, E replaced it with an Envoy S and alongside this 
sold Mr F a five year warranty and 10 year monitoring deal. Again, I haven’t seen anything to 
explain why the Envoy R originally installed stopped working. The warranty that Mr F had 
through R, in addition to the workmanship warranty, included a two year manufacturer’s 
warranty. 
Mr F’s solar panel system was installed in February 2015. This means that if the Envoy R 
had stopped working before February 2017 it would’ve been covered under the 
manufacturer’s warranty and there shouldn’t have been any cost to Mr F. It’s not clear when 
the Envoy R stopped working or why, so I can’t conclude that this should have been 
replaced under the warranty. 
When the Envoy R was replaced Mr F also signed up to a 10 year monitoring service and a 
five year warranty. I’ve considered whether s75 applies to this transaction to decide if 
Creation could be held liable for this additional cost.
S75 of the CCA provides protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. 
S75 states:
“If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12(b) or (c) 
has, in relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier in 
the respect of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against 
the creditor, who, with the supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the 
debtor.”
This means that for Mr F to be able to make a claim against Creation, it would’ve had to 
have financed the new contract Mr F entered with E. But Creation didn’t. Therefore, as there 
is no debtor-creditor-supplier link with Creation, I find it isn’t responsible for refunding Mr F 
the additional money he paid for the monitoring service and new warranty.
Summary 
In summary, I’m satisfied that the benefits of the panels were misrepresented to Mr F. To put 
things right Creation should calculate the potential income and savings to Mr F over the 
10 year term of the loan and restructure the loan to ensure he pays no more than that over 
the original loan term, i.e. make the solar panel system self-funding.
By making the panels self-funding, Mr F’s monthly repayments will likely reduce, meaning 
that he would’ve previously been paying more each month, resulting in an overpayment. And 
as Mr F would’ve been deprived of the monthly overpayment I expect Creation to add 8%

simple interest from the date of the overpayment to the date of the settlement. In a case like 
this, I think the fairest resolution would be to let Mr F have the following selection of options 
as to how he’d like his overpayments to be used:
1.
the overpayments and associated interest are used to reduce the outstanding 
balance of the loan and Mr F continues to pay his existing monthly payment resulting 
in his loan finishing early,
2.
the overpayments and associated interest are used to reduce the outstanding

lower monthly payment until the end of the loan term.
If Mr F accepts my final decision, he should indicate on the acceptance form which of the

I’m satisfied that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mr F first 
contacted Creation that means that his claim should have been upheld. The fact that this did 
not happen undoubtedly caused him trouble and upset and consequently I’ll make an award 
of £100 to cover this.
I’m not persuaded that Creation should refund the additional £320 or the cost of the 10 year 
monitoring service or additional 5 year warranty. 
my final decision
My final decision is to uphold Mr F’s complaint against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. In 
full and final settlement of it, Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must:

allow Mr F to keep the solar panels,

estimate the potential savings and income to Mr F from the panels over the 10 year 
term of the loan and rework it so he pays no more than this. Where possible, it 
should use Mr F’s electricity bills and FIT statements to do this,

add 8% simple interest* per annum to any overpayment made from the date of the 
overpayment made to the date of settlement,

allow Mr F to decide how he’d like his overpayments to be used, using the four 
options described above, and;

pay Mr F £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 January 2020.

Complaint
Mr D is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), following 
a claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
Background
I issued a provisional decision in April 2020, concluding that Mr D’s complaint should be 
upheld. I also set out what Creation should do to put things right. I attach a redacted version 
of my provisional decision which forms part of this final decision.
I invited further comments from both parties before I reconsidered the complaint for a final 
time. Both Mr D and Creation accepted my provisional decision findings.
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I’ve come to the same overall conclusions as set out in my provisional 
decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that Mr D’s complaint should be upheld. In full and final settlement of it, I 
require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:

arrange for the system to be removed from Mr D’s property and make good any 
damage caused at no additional cost to him,

refund the payments Mr D has made towards the system, including any deposit, less 
any benefits he has received. Creation should use Mr D’s FIT statements and 
electricity bills to do this, including a self-consumption rate of 37%,

add 8% simple interest* to the above from the date the payments were made to the 
date of the settlement, and;

pay Mr D £300 for the trouble and upset caused.

Provisional decision
Complaint
Mr D is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”), following a claim 
against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (“CCA”) 1974.
Background
Mr D was contacted by a company, I’ll refer to it as “E”, that supplied and installed solar panel 
systems. Following a meeting at his home, Mr D agreed to enter into a contract with E for it to supply 
and install a solar panel system costing £10,800. To fund this, he also agreed to enter into a 10 year 
fixed sum loan agreement with Creation.
Mr D made a claim under section 75 (“s75”) of the CCA. He said that E had told him that the solar 
panel system would be “self-funded” and that the benefits he’d receive from the system by way of 
feed-in-tariff (“FIT”) income and savings on his electricity bills would more than off-set the monthly 
loan repayments. But this hadn’t happened. Instead, his monthly loan repayments had been much 
higher than any income or benefit he’d received. Mr D also raised some concerns about the quality of 
the installation and that he hadn’t been receiving any FIT payments since 2018.
In response, Creation offered to arrange for an independent expert to visit Mr D’s home and look at 
the quality of the installation. Mr D declined this and referred his complaint to this service.
During the course of our investigation Mr D agreed to Creation arranging for a company to inspect his 
solar panel system. Its report said ‘this installation is of an extremely poor quality throughout.’ It also 
provided a quote for the repair work it had identified. Creation offered to arrange and pay for the 
repair work. In addition to this it also offered to calculate the potential savings and income to Mr D 
over the term of the loan. It then said it would restructure the loan so that he would pay no more than 
this over the 10 year term.
Our investigator thought the offer put forward by Creation was fair. 
Mr D disagreed. He said he wanted the panels to be removed from his home and for all the payments 
he’d made to be returned to him.
As an agreement couldn’t be reached the complaint has been passed to me for review.
 
My provisional findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
I’m required to determine this complaint on the basis of what I consider to be fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances. When considering what is fair and reasonable, I’m required to take into account 
relevant law and regulations; regulator’s rules, guidance and standards, and codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
In this case the relevant law includes s75 of the CCA, which provides protection for consumers for 
goods or services bought using credit. It states:
“If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12(b) or (c) has, in 
relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier in respect of a 
misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against the creditor, who, with the 
supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the debtor.”
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8956648
--------------------------

As Mr D paid for the solar panel system through a fixed sum loan agreement, Creation agrees that 
s75 applies to this transaction. This means that Mr D could claim against Creation – the creditor – for 
any misrepresentation or breach of contract by the supplier in the same way he could have claimed 
against the supplier. So, I have taken s75 into account when deciding what is fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this case.
The offer put forward by Creation is to arrange and pay for the repair work that is needed to bring the 
quality of Mr D’s solar panel installation to the required standard. It has also it will put Mr D in a 
position where his solar panels are self-funding over the original term of the loan. By doing this 
Creation has accepted that the benefits of the solar panel system were misrepresented to Mr D and 
that there was a breach of contract due to the quality of the installation of the system. As a result, this 
decision will deal with what I consider to be fair compensation.
Creation’s offer
I need to decide whether the offer put forward by Creation is fair and reasonable in the particular 
circumstances of this complaint. I understand that in similar complaints our service  has accepted that 
the proposal put forward by Creation, as outlined above, to be fair and reasonable in the individual 
circumstances of those complaints.
The original contract to supply and install Mr D’s solar panel system was covered by the Supply of 
Goods and Services Act (‘SGSA’) 1982. The SGSA sets out that the goods must be of a satisfactory 
quality and services must be carried out with reasonable skill and care.
And within the contract that Mr D had with E for it to supply and install the solar panel system to his 
home, there is an implied term that the trader, in this case E, would carry out the services, i.e. the 
installation, will reasonable skill and care.
I’ve reviewed the report that was completed on Mr D’s solar panel system. The report says:
“On Inspection, this installation is of an extremely poor quality throughout. The panels are not secured 
correctly on the roof  and as a result of this, the limpets are all loose and are close to being blown of 
the roofs. The panels on the front roof have now sagged and are not straight due to the loose fittings 
on the panels. There is a hole on the roof where the roof hook has split a roof tile under the bracker, 
water can easily find its way in from this area on the front roof. The Dc cable and MC4 connectors are 
not tied to the rail and are lying on the roof with water ingress. This has caused a reduction with the 
systems performance. In the loft space the DC cable is unclipped in areas and the Isolators are not 
securely installed atall in the loft. The original installers have used less than half the amount of 
required brackets. The AC cable run is in twin and earth, when it MUST be armoured for any external 
runs and it is also not securely installed and is tied to a loose pipe, which is dangerous practice. 
Finally there are no warning labels or a shutdown procedure installed at the property, which could 
cause a serious incident to another electrician working on the customers electrics as they wouldnt 
know solar was installed internally. The Inverter is also damaged but not from workmanship, simply 
age.”
I’ve also noted in the report there is a section that says “DETAIL ANY IMMEDIATE HEALTH & 
SAFETY ISSUES”. This then says “Several issues as stated above.”
The report outlined above highlights a number of issues with the installation of Mr D’s solar panel 
system. So, like Creation, I’m not satisfied that the installation of Mr D’s solar panel system was 
carried out with reasonable skill and care. Therefore, I consider this to be a breach of contract.  
The report covers a number of key issues with the installation. These include the solar panels being 
so poorly installed that they are close to ‘being blown off the roof’ and that there is further damage to 
Mr D’s roof which is likely to lead to water ingress. It goes on to say that the performance of the solar 
panel system has been reduced and therefore any benefits that Mr D has received are less than he

should have reasonably expected. This is supported by Mr D’s statement that he hasn’t been 
receiving FIT payments since 2018. 
I’ve also gone on to consider that the report highlights there are ‘several’ immediate health and safety 
issues that need to be resolved. I’m of the view that this means that Mr D’s solar panel system is, and 
has been since installation, unsafe and poses an immediate risk to his and others health and safety. 
Again, this demonstrates that the installation wasn’t carried out with reasonable skill and care. In my 
view, this is a significant breach of the contract Mr D had with E.
Whilst I understand that Creation believes that its offer is fair and reasonable, and in similar 
complaints this service has agreed with it, my role is to reach a fair and reasonable outcome taking 
account of the particular circumstances of this complaint. Overall, the report highlights a number of 
major, and what I consider to be key issues, with the solar panel systems installation. These issues 
have placed Mr D, his family and any contractors carrying out work in his home in harms way and I’ve 
taken this into account when considering what is fair and reasonable.
The report mentions that the inverter for the solar panel system is no longer working and needs to be 
replaced. This explains why Mr D hasn’t been receiving FIT payments from his energy provider. I’ve 
noted that this says this is due to age rather than the quality of the installation. 
I’ve looked at the current information available from the Energy Savings Trust. It says that solar 
panels don’t need a lot of maintenance but usually the inverter will need replacing ‘sometime’ during 
the lifetime of the panels at a cost of around £800. 
Mr D’s solar panel system has a 20 year lifetime and was installed in 2015. From the evidence 
discussed above, it appears that his inverter needed replacing shortly after three years of installation. 
I accept that it isn’t unusual for an inverter to need replacing, as set out by the Energy Savings Trust. 
Although I am surprised that it has stopped working just over three years after installation.
I’ve also considered the methodology that Creation has submitted to this service to calculate the total 
benefits of the solar panel system. This methodology is based on the actual and estimated future 
performance of Mr D’s solar panel system.
The methodology Creation follows is to calculate the first year’s benefits based on Mr D’s FIT 
statements and electricity bills. To calculate the remaining benefits, it uses a number of assumptions 
including, but not limited to, a self-consumption rate of 37%, electricity price inflation, the degradation 
rate and the estimated retail price index. I’m of the view that these appear reasonable taking into 
account the actual known figures. For example, the actual average retail price index for the last four 
years doesn’t seem to be far from the assumed figure. 
Usually, I’d consider that the assumptions being used by Creation provide a fair and reasonable basis 
for calculating fair compensation. However, in Mr D’s complaint, I’m not satisfied that they do. Mr D 
hasn’t been in receipt of FIT payments since 2018 so I don’t consider it fair for Creation to use only 
the first year’s FIT statements and electricity bills to calculate the estimated future performance of the 
solar panel system as it isn’t a true reflection of his solar panel systems performance.
Taking account of what I have discussed above in regards to the quality of the installation and 
Creation’s offer to make good the installation and the solar panel system self-funding, I’m not satisfied 
that this provides a fair and reasonable outcome in the particular circumstances of this complaint. 
Fair compensation
Creation doesn’t dispute that the benefits of the solar panel system were misrepresented to Mr D and 
that the poor quality of the installation was a breach of contract as the system installation didn’t take 
place with reasonable skill and care. So, in assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider my 
aim should be to put Mr D in a position he would’ve been in but for the misrepresentation and breach 
of contract by E.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8956648
--------------------------

6
On that basis, taking account of the evidence I have discussed above, I’m minded to ask Creation to 
refund any payments made towards the solar panel system, together with 8% simple interest per 
annum from the date of the payment to the date of the settlement. I’ll allow Creation to take account of 
the benefits that Mr D has received from the system when calculating fair compensation. To do this it 
should use Mr D’s FIT statements and electricity bills. For ease I consider it fair to use a self-
consumption rate of 37% to calculate electricity savings.
I also think that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mr D first contacted Creation 
which means his claim should’ve been upheld. Consequently, I’ll make an award of £300 to recognise 
this.
  
My provisional decision
Subject to any further submissions I should receive from either party by 23 May 2020, my provisional 
decision is that this complaint should be upheld.
In full and final settlement of it, I’m minded to require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:

arrange for the system to be removed from Mr D’s property and make good any damage 
caused at no additional cost to him,

refund the payments Mr D has made towards the system, including any deposit, less any 
benefits he has received. Creation should use Mr D’s FIT statements and electricity bills to do 
this, including a self-consumption rate of 37%,

add 8% simple interest* to the above from the date the payments were made to the date of 
the settlement, and;

pay Mr D £300 for the trouble and upset caused.

complaint
Mr L complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
In 2005 Mr L bought some furniture in a shop and he took out a £799 loan to pay for it. At the 
same time Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £299.71, which was added to the 
loan. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr L wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise he’d pay interest (including £267.25 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr L’s complaint. Creation disagreed and so the case has been 
passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr L’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr L how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the total cost 
included a warranty Mr L bought at the same time. And the credit agreement didn’t show 
the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr L to work out the 
interest himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of 
the policy to be in the credit agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it wasn’t easy to find and I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his attention 
was on buying furniture – not on buying insurance.

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr L aware of the effect 
the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay the 
loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest 
at 29.8%. This meant Mr L would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI 
cost in the first year. 

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr L was borrowing. This was unusual and I think Mr 
L would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. 
Especially as he was borrowing quite a modest amount over a fairly short term. 

I don’t think Mr L would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of how 
much it was going to cost him.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN8964109

For these reasons, I uphold Mr L’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr L borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he 
paid more than he should’ve each month. Mr L needs to get back the extra he’s paid. So, 
Creation should:

Work out and pay Mr L the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr L paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year from 
then on†.

If Mr L made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what he got 
for the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr L’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation 
I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 March 2015.

complaint
Mr G complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy when he took out a loan by telephone in 2009. The cost of the policy 
was added to the loan and repaid over the loan term, with interest.
background
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. He didn’t think Creation had given Mr G a choice 
about buying the policy – or properly told him what it would cost.
Creation disagreed. It said the telephone sales script and loan agreement made clear the 
policy was optional. And the paperwork it sent to Mr G set out the cost.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr G’s complaint.
Creation says the cover might have benefitted Mr G once his sick pay ran out. But I don’t 
need to reach a finding on whether the PPI might have been useful to Mr G – because I’m 
not satisfied Creation gave him a choice about whether to buy it in the first place. This is a 
significant and fundamental failing and is enough to uphold this complaint.
Creation sold the policy to Mr G over the phone. The script (if it was followed) did mention 
‘optional’ cover at the start. But this passing reference was followed immediately by a lot of 
information about what the policy did and didn’t cover. So Mr G could easily have missed it.
Otherwise the script didn’t give a clear indication that the PPI was a separate product. It 
didn’t give the cost of the loan with or without the PPI. And it didn’t ask Mr G for his clear and 
explicit consent to add the PPI to the loan. It only asked whether Creation could ‘go ahead 
and send (him) out documentation including the insurance cover to complete and return”.
I think that, in the context of the whole call, Mr G would have taken this question to be asking 
him whether he wanted the loan paperwork sent to him to sign. I’m not satisfied he would 
have known – from the way the question was worded, or from a brief mention of cancellation 
rights – that he had a choice, and was being asked to make a choice, about buying the PPI.
I can see that Mr G ticked and signed for the PPI on the loan agreement. But that also didn’t 
describe the PPI as optional. By then it looked like an integral part of the loan. The 
agreement didn’t say what would happen if Mr G didn’t tick and sign. And although the very 
last sentence at the bottom of the statement of price said it ‘wasn’t a requirement’ of the loan 
to buy the policy, this wasn’t in a prominent location. Again it could be easily overlooked.
I don’t think Mr G would have bought the policy if he’d been made properly aware he had a 
choice. So I uphold Mr G’s complaint.

fair compensation
Mr G should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand that the loan and PPI ran for their full term.
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr G because PPI was added 
to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr G had taken out the loan 
without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mr G actually paid, and paying him the difference; 
and

paying Mr G simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mr G setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr G needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr G should refer back to Creation if he’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mr G and 
Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
I uphold Mr G’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation 
I’ve described.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2014.

K821x#15
complaint
Mr Z says Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold him payment protection 
insurance (PPI) when he took out a loan in 2008.
background
In 2008, Mr Z bought an electrical item in a shop. He took out a loan to pay for the item over 
four years. At the same time, Creation sold him a PPI policy and the cost of this was added 
to the loan.
The loan had a 12 month ‘buy now pay later’ option which meant that Mr Z could pay off the 
loan, plus a small admin fee, in the first 12 months to avoid paying interest or paying for the 
PPI. Otherwise he’d pay interest on the loan, including interest charged on the PPI, over the 
remaining 48 month term. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Z’s complaint, because she didn’t think Creation had properly told 
Mr Z how much the policy would cost. Creation didn’t agree so the complaint’s been passed 
to me for a decision.
 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We’ve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and I’ve taken this into account in deciding 
Mr Z’s case.
Having done so, I’ve decided to uphold Mr Z’s complaint because I agree with our 
adjudicator – I don’t think Creation gave Mr Z enough information about how much the PPI 
cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr Z to work it out for 
himself. All the important information about the cost of the policy should’ve been in the 
loan agreement.

The statement of price did give a separate figure for the interest – but this was on the 
second page of the policy summary. I don’t think it was easy to find, or where Mr Z would 
expect it to be. I also can’t be sure it was drawn to his attention; particularly when he was 
in a shop and his attention was on buying an electrical item, not on buying insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the PPI. This would’ve been good 
practice and could’ve helped Mr Z understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement also wasn’t enough to make Mr Z aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay 
the loan off during the first 12 months then the whole loan, including the PPI cost, 
attracted interest just over 32%. This meant he’d pay a substantial extra amount of 
interest on the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit was ‘free’ life cover. 

The PPI interest shown in the statement of price was more than the single premium for 
the policy. And the total policy cost was also high compared to the amount Mr Z was 
Ref: 
--------------------------

--------------------------

2
borrowing to buy the electrical item. This was unusual – and I think Mr Z would’ve seen 
this as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. Especially as he 
was borrowing a fairly modest amount and his monthly payments (including the PPI) 
were less than £40.

Creation says Mr Z could have cancelled the policy after signing. But he was entitled to 
be told the important information he needed to know before he signed. I don’t think the 
fact Mr Z didn’t cancel the policy afterwards means he was happy with it. Or that he 
understood what it was really costing him.
Given his circumstances, I don’t think Mr Z would’ve bought the policy if Creation had done 
everything it should have during the sale. So I uphold this complaint. 
what Creation should do to put things right
I understand the loan and PPI have now ended. But Mr Z borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, 
so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he paid more than he should’ve each 
month. Mr Z now needs to get back the extra he’s paid. So Creation should:

work out and pay Mr Z the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

add simple interest to the extra amount Mr Z paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.
If Mr Z made a successful claim under the PPI policy Creation can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr Z a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off, if he asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and so Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
should pay Mr Z the compensation set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr Z to accept or

premium payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy.  
background
In 2005 Mr V bought some furniture in a store and took out a loan of £998 to pay for it. At the 
same time, Creation sold Mr V a PPI policy. The policy cost £325.54, which was added to 
the loan. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr V wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise, he’d pay interest (including £290.42 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr V’s complaint. They didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And they didn’t think Mr V would have bought the policy if it 
had done so. 
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr V was given would 
have made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints. 
I’ve decided to uphold Mr V’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr V how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium but it didn’t set out the total cost of the 
PPI or show the PPI interest as a separate figure. Instead the total charge for the credit 
was given as a figure which included the interest for the loan as well as the PPI. And it 
wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr V to work out for himself how much the PPI would cost 
him. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the policy to 
be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr V would expect it to be. And I can’t be sure 
it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his attention was on 
buying his furniture – not on buying insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr V better understand what the policy was costing him.


The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr V aware of the effect 
the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay the 
loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest 
at 29.8%. This meant Mr V would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI 
cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover. 

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr V was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr V would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. 

I don’t think Mr V would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of how 
much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr V’s complaint. 
fair compensation 
Mr V should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term.
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr V because PPI was added to 
the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr V had taken out the loan 
without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mr V actually paid, and paying him the difference; 
and

paying Mr V simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mr V setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr V needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr V should refer back to Creation if he’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mr V and 
Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that Mr V’s complaint is upheld and Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
must pay Mr V fair compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2014.

complaint
Mrs A complains about a single premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy sold to 
her in May 2008 over the telephone by Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. 
The policy covered a £5,000, five-year personal loan for debt consolidation. It provided life, 
accident, sickness and unemployment cover. Mrs A says the policy was mis-sold. 
background
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint be upheld. She didn’t think Creation had done 
enough to make Mrs A aware that she wouldn’t be entitled to a proportionate refund if she 
refinanced the loan early and had to cancel the policy. And the adjudicator didn’t think Mrs A 
would have agreed to buy the policy, in her particular circumstances, if she had been given 
that information. 
Creation disagreed. It said documentation was issued to Mrs A after she gave her initial 
consent to the policy during the telephone call. The documents clarified the details of the 
policy and the onus was on Mrs A to read them and to ask for further information if she didn’t 
understand them. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. In doing so, I have taken into account any 
relevant regulatory rules and guidance, as well as the law and good industry practice when 
the policy was sold.
We’ve been looking at complaints about the sale of PPI for several years now. And we have 
a well-established approach, which is published on our website. I think the relevant 
considerations in this case are materially the same as our published approach. 
Broadly speaking, what I need to consider here is:
•
whether Creation gave Mrs A advice and, if it did, whether it took adequate steps to 
ensure the policy was suitable for her needs; 
•
whether Creation gave Mrs A information which was clear, fair and not misleading so 
she could make an informed choice about the policy she was buying; and
•
if there were faults with the way Creation sold the policy, whether Mrs A is worse off 
as a result (in other words would she have done something different – such as not 
buy the policy – but for any shortcomings?)
did Creation recommend the policy to Mrs A?
Creation says this sale took place on a non-advised basis. It hasn’t been able to provide a 
call recording. But it has provided a sales script it says was in use at the time. That script 
doesn’t suggest that advice would have been given. Creation has also provided documents it 
says would have been issued to Mrs A immediately after the call – including the credit 
agreement, and a key facts document containing a policy summary and statement of price. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9041277
--------------------------

2
These documents also tend to suggest that Creation didn’t give Mrs A any specific 
recommendation. 
Mrs A can’t remember whether she was given advice. She does remember that the policy 
was sold over the telephone. She says she doesn’t recall any information being given to her 
about the PPI, or the cost of it. 
Overall – based on the available evidence – I’m not persuaded that Creation gave Mrs A a 
specific recommendation to buy the policy. This means it didn’t have to take steps to ensure 
the policy was suitable for Mrs A. But it did have to give her enough information to allow her 
to make an informed choice about the policy she was buying. 
did Creation give Mrs A enough information – and did it make a difference if not?
It’s here that I think Creation failed to live up to its responsibilities towards Mrs A, and why 
I’m not satisfied Mrs A made an informed choice to add the policy to her loan. I think 
Creation failed to properly bring to Mrs A’s attention that the policy didn’t offer a pro-rata 
refund if it was cancelled early. And I think this is important information which would have 
impacted on Mrs A’s decision to buy the policy if she had been made properly aware of it. 
When explaining why I’ve come to my findings it’s important to consider the type of policy 
Mrs A bought, and also the context in which she bought it. 
This was a single premium PPI policy. Single premium PPI policies are paid for in a very 
different way to most other insurance products. In particular, their cost structure is different – 
because the initial premium cost is often significantly increased by the interest added to it 
over the term of the loan. And the fact that the single premium (and the interest on it) is 
added to the loan up front – and is then paid back gradually over the term of the loan – 
means they often also have restrictive cancellation terms. Overall, this is not a 
straightforward way to pay for insurance and can lead to significant cost if cancelled early. 
This is not something Mrs A was likely to have much understanding of. 
The single premium cost of the policy sold to Mrs A was £1,215.76. A further £613.35 of 
interest added to the premium over the loan term brought the total cost of the PPI to 
£1,829.11. According to the policy summary and policy wording, it offered a 5% refund of the 
initial premium if the policy was cancelled after 36 months. It offered a 13% refund if 
cancelled at 24 months. 
Mrs A had telephoned Creation to apply for a £5,000 loan for debt consolidation. And she 
was taking it over a reasonably long period of time – five years. There was a high likelihood 
that she would look to re-finance the loan again at some point during that five-year period. 
So the impact of the policy’s cancellation provisions on her ability to refinance the loan – and 
what it might cost her to do so – was important information. Creation should have drawn 
Mrs A’s attention to this important information. 
As there’s no call recording, I can’t be sure what Mrs A was told during the telephone call. If 
I assume that the script was followed I can see that it required the call handler to tell Mrs A 
that she had a statutory right to cancel the policy for up to 30 days after the agreement 
started, at no cost. 
The script then required the call handler to explain what would happen if Mrs A cancelled 
outside that 30-day period. However, according to the script, Mrs A would only have been 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9041277
--------------------------

3
told that she would “..only be entitled to a partial refund of the original premium”. There was 
no explanation of how that refund would be calculated, or what it might amount to. Nor was 
there any explanation that the ‘partial refund’ wouldn’t be calculated on a pro-rata basis (as 
Mrs A might otherwise reasonably have expected). So the information disclosed in the call 
script wasn’t enough to adequately draw Mrs A’s attention to the restrictive cancellation 
terms. 
The script does indicate that Mrs A would have been told to read the policy terms and 
conditions for details of ‘cancellation rights’. And Creation says documents were sent to 
Mrs A for further clarification after it ‘gained her initial consent to the PPI’. That is my concern 
here. Mrs A effectively agreed to have the PPI added to her loan during the telephone 
conversation with Creation. It’s reasonable to conclude that she would place greater reliance 
on what she was told during the telephone call, than on anything she received in writing 
afterwards. So it’s during the telephone call that Creation should have drawn Mrs A’s 
attention to the significant features of the policy, including the restrictive nature of the 
cancellation terms. I’m not satisfied that sending written information afterwards was enough 
to mitigate Creation’s failure to disclose this information orally. 
I also note that:

The policy summary does refer to the non-pro-rata refund and gives the 5% refund figure 
as an example. However, it’s not clear that Mrs A ever saw this document, or that it was 
adequately drawn to her attention. 

Even if she did see the policy summary, the refund information was positioned lower 
down the document after a lot of other information about exclusions and limitations. And 
it was in the section entitled “Early termination of loan” rather than in the “Right of 
cancellation” section the script suggests her attention would have been directed towards. 
So I’m not persuaded Mrs A would have easily found this information. 

The “Right of cancellation” section of the summary referred Mrs A to the policy document 
for further information. Again it isn’t clear that Mrs A received the policy document. But 
even if she did, the relevant information is provided on pages 18 and 19 of a 25-page 
document. I don’t consider that this information was prominently positioned, or 
adequately brought to Mrs A’s attention. 

Finally, it would have been difficult for Mrs A to work out from the percentage examples 
given how much she might lose in real terms if she cancelled the policy early.
Creation says the onus was on Mrs A to review the information given and ask for further 
information if she didn’t understand something. That isn’t correct. It was Creation’s 
responsibility to provide Mrs A with enough information about the main features and benefits 
of the policy to enable her to make an informed choice. For the reasons given above I find it 
failed to do so here. And, bearing in mind why Mrs A was taking out the loan and also the 
length of the term, I find that Mrs A wouldn’t have bought the policy, but for Creation’s failing.
fair redress
I find that, if Mrs A hadn’t bought the PPI policy, she would still have gone ahead with the 
loan. Therefore she should be put back in the position she would have been in if the 
PPI policy hadn’t been sold. The loan and the PPI policy had a term of five years so should 
by now have run their course. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should therefore:

A.
Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mrs A because PPI was 
added to the loan by:
•
calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mrs A had taken out the 
loan without PPI.
•
subtracting those amounts from what Mrs A actually paid and paying her the 
difference. 
•
paying Mrs A interest (simple, not compound) on each of these amounts at the rate 
of 8% a year from the date each payment was made to the date the redress is paid†.
B.
Write to Mrs A to set out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation Consumer Finance Ltd is required to deduct basic rate tax from this 
part of the compensation. Whether Mrs A needs to take any further action will depend on her 
financial circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our 
website. Mrs A should refer back to Creation Consumer Finance Ltd if she is unsure of the 
approach it has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want 
to know more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Mrs A compensation calculated in accordance with the instructions set out above 
under ‘fair redress’.

complaint
Ms M complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd provided her with wrong information 
about paying down her fixed sum loan agreement which led her to taking out further credit 
unnecessarily.
background
Ms M entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation in February 2017. In 
January 2018, she contacted Creation and was told that if she made an additional payment 
she could reduce her monthly payments. Ms M says that based on this information she took 
out a loan with the intention of using part of this to make a lump sum payment towards her 
agreement. However she was then told that any additional payment would not reduce her 
monthly payments but instead the term of her agreement.
Ms M says that the incorrect information meant she borrowed more than she would have 
done and now has to make the same monthly payments to Creation as well as the 
repayments on her new loan.
Creation accepts that Ms M was provided with incorrect advice. It says it paid her £50 
because of this and says that feedback was provided to the agent that gave the incorrect 
information. It also removed a missed payment marker that had been applied to Ms M’s 
credit file.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. He didn’t think that the incorrect information 
provided by Creation led Ms M to take out more money than she required. Based on this he 
thought the £50 compensation was fair.
Ms M did not accept our investigator’s view. She reiterated that she was given wrong 
information and said she had spent time on the phone trying to deal with this issue which 
had been going on for a long time. She did not accept that £50 compensation was sufficient.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have listened to the call on which Ms M was told that if she made an additional payment 
she could reduce the amount of her monthly payments. Creation has not disputed that Ms M 
was provided with the wrong information and has confirmed that any additional payments will 
result in less interest being paid overall and the agreement term being reduced. 
Ms M says that because of the advice she received she took out a £10,000 loan which in 
part was to pay down her agreement with Creation. She says that had she known she would 
not be able to reduce her monthly payments she would have taken out a smaller loan. She 
has provided information on what she has used around £5,500 of the loan to do (including 
paying off other debts).
Creation has paid Ms M £50 compensation as well as amending her credit file. Ms M says 
that the compensation paid is not enough. She says she is now left paying the same monthly 
amount to Creation alongside her repayments on the £10,000 loan. She also says this issue 
has caused her trouble and inconvenience.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9062724
--------------------------

2
My role is not to punish the business but where a mistake has been made to ensure that the 
customer is put back in the position they would have been had the mistake not been made 
and, where appropriate, award compensation. The outstanding issue in this case is whether 
£50 is enough to compensate Ms M for the trouble and upset she has been caused.
Having listened to the calls made in January, Ms M was given the incorrect advice on 
16 January and then contacted Creation again to discuss her agreement on 17 January 
where she was told monthly payment amounts would not be reduced. On this call she says 
that she has taken out a loan to make the additional payment. Later on this call the new loan 
is discussed and it is noted that the new loan is interest free and that it could not be given 
back. 
So while a mistake was made and Ms M was given incorrect advice, given the new loan was 
interest free, using this to pay an additional amount towards her agreement would still have 
been beneficial. I say this because although the monthly payment amount would not change 
the term would reduce and the overall interest paid under the agreement would reduce. That 
said I understand that Ms M may not have wished to do this after finding out the monthly 
payments would not reduce. 
Ms M has said she has used part of the loan to make repayments on other accounts which 
would have benefitted Ms M so it is reasonable to accept that she would have taken out the 
loan (even if a lesser amount) even if she had not been given incorrect advice by Creation. 
Overall based on the information I have received I cannot say that she has suffered a 
financial loss through taking out the new loan.
I understand why Ms M is upset that she could not reduce her monthly payments after being 
told that this could happen. However Creation has explained that this is not something it 
does. As set out above I do not find that the issues raised in this complaint have resulted in a 
financial loss to Ms M but she has been caused trouble and upset. 
Ms M was given incorrect advice on 16 January and this was identified on the call on 
17 January. So while this issue has caused Ms M distress and inconvenience given the short 
time frame in which the information was corrected, I find that the £50 compensation provided 
by Creation is sufficient.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2018.

complaint
Mrs H says Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold her payment protection 
insurance (PPI) when she took out a loan in 2007.
background
In 2007, Mrs H bought an electrical item in a shop. She took out a loan to pay for the item 
over four years. At the same time, Creation sold her a PPI policy – the cost of this was 
added to the loan.
The loan had a 12 month ‘buy now pay later’ option which meant that Mrs H could pay off 
the loan, plus a small admin fee, in the first 12 months to avoid paying interest or paying for 
the PPI. Otherwise she’d pay interest on the loan, including interest charged on the PPI, 
over the remaining 48 month term. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mrs H’s complaint, because he didn’t think Creation had properly told 
Mrs H how much the policy would cost. Creation didn’t agree so the complaint’s been 
passed to me for a decision.
 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We’ve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and I’ve taken this into account in deciding 
Mrs H’s case.
Having done so, I’ve decided to uphold Mrs H’s complaint because I agree with the 
adjudicator – I don’t think Creation gave Mrs H enough information about how much the PPI 
cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mrs H to work it out for 
herself. All the important information about the cost of the policy should’ve been in the 
loan agreement.

The statement of price did give a separate figure for the interest – but this was on the 
second page of the policy summary. I don’t think it was easy to find, or where Mrs H 
would expect it to be. I also can’t be sure it was drawn to her attention; particularly when 
she was in a shop and her attention was on buying an electrical item, not on buying 
insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the PPI. This would’ve been good 
practice and could’ve helped Mrs H understand what the policy was costing her.  

The information in the credit agreement also wasn’t enough to make Mrs H aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If she didn’t pay 
the loan off during the first 12 months then the whole loan, including the PPI cost, 
attracted interest just over 32%. This meant she’d pay a substantial extra amount of 
interest on the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit was ‘free’ life cover. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9111055
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest shown in the statement of price was nearly the same as the single 
premium for the policy. And the total policy cost was also high compared to the amount 
Mrs H was borrowing to buy the electrical item. This was unusual – and I think Mrs H 
would’ve seen this as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. 
Especially as she was borrowing a fairly modest amount and her monthly payments 
(including the PPI) were less than £30.

Creation says Mrs H could have cancelled the policy after signing. But she was entitled 
to be told the important information she needed to know before she signed. I don’t think 
the fact Mrs H didn’t cancel the policy afterwards means she was happy with it. Or that 
she understood what it was really costing her.
Given her circumstances, I don’t think Mrs H would’ve bought the policy if Creation had done 
everything it should have during the sale. So I uphold this complaint. 
what Creation should do to put things right
I understand the loan and PPI have now ended. But Mrs H borrowed extra to pay for the 
PPI, so her loan was bigger than it should’ve been and she paid more than she should’ve 
each month. Mrs H now needs to get back the extra she’s paid. So Creation should:

work out and pay Mrs H the difference between what she paid each month on the loan 
and what she would’ve paid each month without PPI.

add simple interest to the extra amount Mrs H paid each month from when she paid it 
until she gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.
If Mrs H made a successful claim under the PPI policy Creation can take off what she got for 
the claim from the amount it owes her.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mrs H a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off, if she asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and so Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
should pay Mrs H the compensation set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2016.

complaint
Mr H complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold him a single 
premium payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy. 
background
In 2007 Mr H bought an electrical good in a shop and took out a £523.96 loan to pay for it. At 
the same time Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £275.01 and was added to the 
loan. 
The loan had a 12 month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr H wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before a date that was set out on the agreement. Otherwise he would pay interest 
(including £338.02 of interest on the policy) over the remaining 48 months of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr H’s complaint. They didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And they didn’t think Mr H would have bought the policy if it 
had done so. 
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr H was given would 
have made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr H’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr H how much the policy cost. I say this because:
•
The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the total cost 
included a warranty Mr H bought at the same time.  And the credit agreement didn’t 
show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr H to 
work out the interest himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information 
about the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.
•
The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr H would expect it to be. And I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his 
attention was on buying an electrical item – not on buying insurance.

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been 
good practice and might have helped Mr H to understand what the policy was costing 
him.  
•
The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr H aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t 
pay the loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, 
attracted interest at 32.4%. This meant Mr H would pay a substantial extra amount of

interest on the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ 
life cover.  
•
The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr H was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr H would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as he was borrowing quite a modest amount over a fairly short 
term. 
•
I don’t think Mr H would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr H’s complaint.
fair compensation 
Mr H should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term.
Creation should now therefore:
A.
Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr H because PPI was 
added to the loan by:
•
calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr H had taken out the 
loan without PPI;
•
subtracting those amounts from what Mr H actually paid, and paying him the 
difference; and
•
paying Mr H simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date 
each payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B.
Write to Mr H setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr H needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr H should refer back to Creation if he’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mr H and 
Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr H’s complaint. And Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
should pay Mr H fair compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2014.

complaint
I understand in 2006 Mr K bought goods from an electrical shop. In order to do so he 
applied, through the shop’s sales process, for a loan from Creation Consumer Finance 
(Creation). As part of this sale, he was sold a single premium payment protection insurance 
policy (‘PPI’). Mr K says this was mis-sold because he was not aware he had taken the 
policy out and does not believe it was suitable for him because he was self employed at the 
time. 
background
I issued my provisional decision in March 2013. I said I had carefully considered all of the 
available evidence and arguments from the outset, in order to decide what was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances. I also took into account relevant regulatory rules as well as 
the law and good industry practice at the time the policy was sold.
Having done so, I was not minded to uphold Mr K’s complaint. In particular, I concluded that:

there was some evidence he agreed to take out the policy because he had ticked and 
signed the section of the credit agreement relating to PPI; 

I could not be sure Creation met his information needs but I did not consider the policy 
conditions (particularly as they affect the self employed) would have significantly 
restricted Mr K’s ability to make a successful unemployment claim; 

he did not appear to have a strong need for flexibility when taking out the policy, so 
further information about its restrictive cancellation terms was unlikely to have affected 
his decision to take it out; 

although it did not appear he had been provided with full information about the cost of 
the policy, I was not persuaded he would have acted differently if this had been made 
clearer to him.
I invited both parties to let me have any further comments they wished me to consider before 
I reached a final decision. Creation confirmed it was satisfied with the provisional decision 
and had no further comments to make. Mr K did provide a further response. In summary he 
said:

he intended to pay off the loan before the end of the deferred period but as he was late 
in doing so decided to let it run;

he would not have knowingly taken out this policy if he had been aware of the exclusions 
and does not believe it was ever suitable for him;

the paperwork does not show the monthly cost of the PPI; 

when he tried to make a claim, it was not made clear to him what he would need to do in 
order to meet the policy terms and conditions.

my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I agree Mr K was not provided with clear information about the cost of the policy. However, 
the question I must then consider is whether he would have decided against taking it out if 
he had understood more about this. I appreciate Mr K’s initial intention was to pay off the 
loan before the end of the deferred period, but as he did not then it seems to me he had a 
potential need to ensure he was able to meet his ongoing repayments. And it does not 
appear he had any other policies in place that would have enabled him to do so. In addition, 
as he was self employed he would not have received any employer benefits if he was not 
working. 
So it does appear he had some need of the cover the policy offered and I do not consider it 
implausible he might have decided to take this out (which his signature on the credit 
agreement indicates he agreed to do). And I understand the monthly cost of the policy was 
£29.40. This does not appear unaffordable for someone in Mr K’s circumstances. Given he 
appears to have had some need of cover, I do not feel I could safely conclude additional 
information on cost would have affected his decision to take it out. 
I appreciate Mr K does not believe the policy was suitable for him but, as this was an 
information only sale, Creation was not required to assess this. However, I accept it may not 
have drawn the policy exclusions, in particular as they relate to the self employed, to his 
attention. But given these did not, for example, require him to permanently cease trading, 
I do not consider someone in Mr K’s circumstances would have been put off taking out the 
policy if they had understood more about them. If Mr K believes he was provided with 
inaccurate information when he did come to make a claim then it is of course open to him to 
make a separate complaint about this issue.

complaint
Miss V complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd will not reduce the amount of her 
loan even though she did not receive all the goods she ordered and some that were received 
were damaged.
background
Miss V ordered a number of items of furniture in 2012 for which she paid a deposit. She 
agreed a finance agreement through Creation to pay the balance by instalments. Although 
some items were delivered, Miss V says that she told Creation in April 2013 that the full 
order had not been received. She also said that some items were damaged and the store 
had agreed a 20% discount for these. The store that Miss V purchased the goods from is in 
administration and Creation was not able to safely conclude that the items had not been 
delivered in full.
The adjudicator did not recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He concluded that 
there was not sufficient evidence to show that Miss V did not receive all of the order or that a 
20% discount had been offered.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by our adjudicator for broadly the reasons given.
I fully understand Miss V’s frustration in that she says that she is now paying for goods that 
she simply did not receive. However, like the adjudicator, I find that I am unable to safely 
conclude that the items she originally purchased were not all delivered. Furthermore, whilst 
I do not doubt that Miss V did tell Creation that some of the items she received were 
damaged and that the store had agreed a 20% discount; unfortunately there is no record of 
this. In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that I should require Creation to reduce the 
amount outstanding on Miss V’s account.
Miss V also says that she returned a damaged item to the store but never received a 
replacement. Again, neither the administrators nor Creation have any record of this and 
Miss V has been unable to provide copies of a delivery or collection note.
The administrators have confirmed that there is an outstanding credit on Miss V’s account. 
Creation has offered to apply this credit to the amount outstanding and to pay a further £50 
as a goodwill gesture for the time it took to investigate Miss V’s complaint. I consider this to 
be fair and reasonable. If, upon reflection, Miss V decides that she now wishes to accept the 
offer, she should contact Creation directly.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.

complaint
Miss H complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd failed to give her a correct settlement 
figure so her loan wasn’t paid off as she’d thought it would be and is now showing in arrears. 
background
Miss H had a loan with Creation. In February 2018 she went online to pay off the loan early. 
She was given a settlement figure of £10,367.26 which she paid and she received a 
confirmation the loan had been paid off. But a direct debit of £291.23 was due the same day. 
This wasn’t included in the settlement figure. Miss H cancelled the direct debit so this 
payment didn’t go through and this left Miss H’s account in arrears.
Creation contacted Miss H in March 2018 to tell her there were arrears on the account. But 
she said she’d paid it off and had confirmation of that so she shouldn’t have to pay any 
more. She made a complaint but Creation rejected it because it said she should’ve known 
the settlement figure didn’t include the direct debit that was due. So Miss H came to this 
service. 
Our investigator didn’t think the complaint should be upheld so Miss H asked for review by 
an ombudsman. I thought the complaint should be upheld in part so I issued a provisional 
decision. Creation provided feedback on the provisional decision but as both Creation and 
Miss H accepted the decision overall, my findings have not changed.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
The figures on Miss H’s account show that a further £291.23 was due the day Miss H made 
her settlement payment though it wasn’t taken because the direct debit was cancelled. 
However, when Miss H looked at her account online, she clearly intended to pay off the loan 
and paid the settlement amount she was given. She wasn’t told the settlement figure didn’t 
include the direct debit that was pending. And she was given a confirmation she’d paid off 
the loan. 
Creation said she should’ve known she owed more because a higher figure was quoted 
when she’d consulted her account previously. But when she contacted Creation earlier, she 
was just enquiring about her interest rates so I don’t think she would’ve noticed the 
settlement figure was higher. I think Miss H acted in good faith when she cancelled the direct 
debit as she believed the account was settled but the information Creation gave her wasn’t 
clear.
In the circumstances, I think Creation’s poor communication led to Miss H paying less than 
she should’ve to settle the debt. But this created a problem for Miss H as the account then 
went into arrears. This was worrying for her as she believed she’d paid the debt off but her 
credit record was showing the account in arrears. Credit records are designed to provide an 
accurate picture of the way a person manages their finances. But in this case, I find any 
arrears have arisen because of Creation’s poor communication about the settlement figure, 
not because Miss H failed to make payments on her account. Therefore, to put things right, I 
find that Creation should write off the arrears and amend Miss H’s credit record so it reflects 
her intention to pay off the loan in full in February 2018.

--------------------------
DRN9182928

2
my final decision
For the reasons given above, it’s my final decision that this complaint is upheld in part as 
Miss H’s account went into arrears due to poor communication from Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should write off the outstanding debt and 
amend Miss H’s credit file to show that the debt was settled in full in February 2018.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 May 2019.

K821x#9
summary of complaint
Mrs S complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold her a Payment Protection 
Insurance (“PPI”) policy in connection with a loan to purchase furniture in 2005. 
my findings
In deciding what is fair and reasonable in the individual circumstances of this case, I have 
considered the issues in accordance with our general approach to considering complaints 
about the mis-sale of PPI, which is well-documented. This includes taking into account the 
law and good industry practice at the time the policy was sold and any regulatory rules and 
guidance relevant to this complaint. 
The key issues I need to consider in this complaint are:

whether Creation gave Mrs S information that was clear, fair, not misleading and 
sufficient to put her in a position to make an informed choice about whether to 
purchase the payment protection policy; and

whether in giving any advice or recommendation, Creation took adequate steps to 
ensure that the loan protection policy was suitable for Mrs S’s needs.
If there were shortcomings in the way in which Creation sold the policy, I then need to 
consider whether Mrs S is worse off as a result. That is, would she be in a different position 
now if there had not been any shortcomings?
The policy was purchased by Mrs S alongside a loan to buy furniture in 2005. The sale took 
place in a face to face meeting, and Creation has reported that this was not an advised sale. 
As such, Creation was not required to assess the suitability of the policy in relation to 
Mrs S’s personal circumstances. It was, however, required to provide sufficient, clear 
information about the policy and its terms and limitations to allow Mrs S to make an informed 
choice about whether to purchase the cover offered.
Because there is no record of what was said at the meeting I must decide, based on 
documentation and testimony, what is most likely to have happened.
Mrs S took out a loan of £ 2,486 to purchase a suite of furniture. Creation set up the loan 
over three years with a PPI policy at a cost of £892.94. This policy offered life, accident, 
sickness and unemployment cover for Mrs S. The cost of the PPI was added to the original 
loan and attracted interest.
Having reviewed the information provided I outline my findings below.
Optional nature of the policy: Mrs S has reported that she felt pressured into taking the PPI 
at the meeting, having been told that she could not have the loan without the cover. I have 
carefully considered all the documentation that has been provided to me, and have seen no 
evidence to indicate that the optional nature of the policy was drawn to Mrs S’s attention. I 
am aware that Creation has said that the sales process would have required that the sales 
person drew the optional nature of the policy to her attention, but has provided no further 
evidence in this regard. I also note that an X had been drawn onto both the place to sign for 
the credit agreement and the place to sign for the PPI. While I accept that this may just have 
been done by the sales person to make it easier for Mrs S, I consider it is also equally 
possible that she was simply told where to sign, confirming her belief that the PPI was not 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9211899
--------------------------

2
optional. On balance of probabilities, I am persuaded that Mrs S may not have been made 
aware that the policy was optional and that it was not a requirement of securing the loan. 
Cost of the policy: Having reviewed the Customer Credit Agreement I consider that Mrs S 
would have had difficulty understanding the true cost of the PPI. The cash cost of the PPI 
had been amalgamated with the cost of a warranty and the cost of the interest payable was 
not provided as a separate amount. I cannot know what was said to Mrs S during the 
meeting, and accept that the Creation representative may have described the costs in great 
detail. However, on the evidence before me, I am not persuaded that Mrs S would have 
realised that the PPI had added over £1,689 to her borrowing. Having reviewed records of 
conversations that Mrs S had with our adjudicator, I am persuaded that cost would have 
been an important factor for her. She was working long hours in a fairly low-paid job, and I 
am not persuaded that Mrs S would have agreed to purchase the PPI had the full impact 
upon the cost of the loan and her monthly repayments been made clear to her. The full cost 
of the PPI almost equalled the cost of the furniture that Mrs S had gone there to buy. I am 
not persuaded that she would have purchased the PPI had the full cost been made clear to 
her.
Based on the evidence before me, and as outlined above, I am not persuaded that Creation 
treated Mrs S fairly. I am satisfied that if Creation had properly informed Mrs S at the time 
that she was taking the loan, she would not have gone ahead with the PPI policy. It follows 
that I uphold this complaint.
redress
I consider that the appropriate approach to fair compensation in this case is to require 
Creation to compensate Mrs S by putting her (so far as is now practicable) in the position 
she would have been in, had she not taken out the policy. I understand that the loan and PPI 
ran to term.
In this case Creation should:
(A)
calculate, and pay Mrs S the amount of the net payments she made in respect of the 
PPI (including any interest and charges) by comparing:

the payments actually made; 
­
the payments which would have applied if Mrs S had taken the loan without PPI; 
and
­
add interest on each of these net payments at the rate of 8% per year simple†  
from the date of each payment to the date the compensation is paid; and
(B)
set out in writing for Mrs S the details of the calculations under (A).
† – This part of the compensation may be subject to income tax. The treatment of this part of 
the compensation in Mrs S’s hands will depend on whether Creation has deducted basic rate 
tax from the compensation and Mrs S’s financial circumstances. More information about the 
tax position can be found on our website at: 
www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/guidance/comp_tax.htm. 
Mrs S should refer back to Creation if she is unsure of the approach it has taken and 
Creation and Mrs S should contact HM Revenue and Customs if they want to know more 
about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation.

my decision 
Based on the evidence provided to me by both parties, and reflecting upon what is most 
likely to have happened, I consider that the complaint should be upheld and that Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd should compensate Mrs S as outlined above. I make no further 
award against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.

Complaint
Ms B is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), following 
her claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
Background
Ms B and her ex-husband were contacted by a company, I’ll refer to them as “G”, that 
supplied and installed solar panel systems. Following a meeting, they agreed to enter into a 
contract with G for it to supply and install a solar panel system costing about £7,000. To fund 
this Ms B also agreed to enter into a 10 year fixed sum loan agreement with Creation.
Ms B made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the CCA. She said that G had told her that the 
solar panels would be ‘self-funded’ and that the monthly loan repayments would be more 
than off-set by the feed-in-tariff (‘FIT’) income and savings generated. But that hadn’t 
happened. Instead, the monthly loan repayments had been much higher than the income. 
Since the solar panels had been installed Ms B had divorced and paid G to remove the solar 
panels from her previous home. G are currently storing them for her for no charge. G had 
agreed that it would install the solar panels on a new property but as Ms B was renting, she 
was unable to have them reinstalled.
In its final response letter, Creation said that it didn’t think the benefits of the solar panels 
had been misrepresented. Unhappy with this response, Ms B referred the complaint to our 
service.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. He felt the benefits of the solar 
panel system had been misrepresented. He recommended Creation:

unwind the loan agreement,

refund Ms B any payments she’d made towards the loan agreement minus any 
benefits she’d received from when the panels were fitted,

add 8% simple interest to any payments Ms B had made from date of payment to 
date of settlement,

remove any record of the loan agreement from Ms B’s credit file,

refund the amount Ms B paid G to have the panels removed from her previous home, 
and;

add 8% simple interest to the above amount from date of payment to date of 
settlement.
Creation didn’t accept our investigator’s view. In summary it said:

it didn’t think the benefits of the solar panel system had been misrepresented to Ms 
B, and

it was Ms B’s choice to have the solar panels removed from her previous home.
Ms B didn’t respond to the investigator’s view.
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9221681
--------------------------

2
When considering what is fair and reasonable, I’m required to take into account: relevant law 
and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and standards and codes of practice; 
and, where appropriate, what I would consider to have been good industry practice at the 
relevant time.
In this case the relevant law includes section 56 (‘s56’) and s75 of the CCA, which provides 
protection for consumers for goods or services bought using credit. S75 states:
“If the debtor under a debtor-creditor-supplier agreement falling within section 12(b) or (c) 
has, in relation to a transaction financed by the agreement, any claim against the supplier in 
the respect of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a like claim against 
the creditor, who, with the supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and severally liable to the 
debtor.”
As Ms B paid for the solar panels with a fixed sum loan, Creation agrees that s75 applies to 
this transaction. This means that Ms B could claim against Creation – the creditor – for any 
misrepresentation or breach of contract by G in the same way she could have claimed 
against G, the supplier. I’ve taken s75 into account when deciding what’s fair in the 
circumstances of this case.
S56 is also relevant as it says that any negotiations between Ms B and G as the supplier are 
deemed to have been conducted by G as an agent of Creation.
Ms B says she and her ex-husband were cold called and during a sales meeting told that the 
installation would be entirely self-financing. I haven’t seen anything to show that she’d shown 
a previous interest in solar panels before she was approached by G. It is difficult to see why 
Ms B would’ve agreed to the installation of the solar panels, financed through a loan that 
would’ve increased her monthly outgoings. I therefore think it is unlikely that Ms B would’ve 
agreed to install the solar panel system and take out a loan with Creation unless she had 
been led to believe that it would be self-funding and come at no additional cost to her.
I’ve considered the paperwork that was given to Ms B when she agreed to the installation of 
the solar panels. One of the documents that had been provided appears to be a personal 
illustration for Ms B. It lists the expected annual benefits to Ms B from the FIT and electricity 
savings to be around £990. The same document also shows a lifetime benefit of 
approximately £50,000 over 20 years again made up of FIT and electricity bill savings. There 
is also a graph to show when the solar panel system would’ve provided enough benefit to 
offset their cost. This shows a payback period of seven years and is based on the price Ms 
B’s paid.
Taking all of the above into account, I believe it is more likely than not that the salesperson 
for G led Ms B to believe that the solar panels would be self-funding and the income and 
savings would be sufficient to cover the repayments required under the loan agreement.
I’m of the opinion that for the solar panels to be self-funding, and come at no additional cost 
to Ms B, the savings and income she would receive should have been sufficient to cover the 
repayments due under the loan agreement.
For clarity, Ms B’s expected savings and income from the solar panels are from:
(1) generation income tariff,
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9221681
--------------------------

3
(2) export tariff income, and;
(3) savings to Ms B by using the electricity generated by the panels rather than buying it 
from her energy provider.
On the personal illustration discussed above, the total return form the above three items, in 
the first year, was £990. My understanding is that when G arrived to install the solar panels 
they couldn’t place as many panels on the roof as first expected. So, Ms B was given a 
revised figure of £658. The loan payments were about £1,085 a year.
Taking these figures into account Ms B was likely to be out of pocket by about £100 in the 
first year based on the original figure and, around £430 in the first year based on the revised 
expectations. And these figures would broadly be the same during the term of the loan. This 
means that based on either figure, the solar panels weren’t self-funding. So, I’m satisfied that 
G misrepresented the benefits to Ms B.
Ms B didn’t have any previous experience of solar panel systems and was approached by G. 
I’m satisfied that Ms B decided to go ahead with the solar panel system based on the 
representation made by G that the system would be self-funding. 
For the reasons I’ve explained, I find that Ms B has suffered a loss as a result of the 
misrepresentation made by G. The system wasn’t self-funding and Ms B has ended up 
paying a significant amount over the savings. And as Creation has equal liability for the 
misrepresentation made by G, I find that it is responsible for Ms B’s loss.
The role of this service is to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses 
providing financial services fairly and reasonably with minimum formality. In cases like this 
one, determining fair compensation isn’t an exact science. My role is to arrive at a fair and 
reasonable outcome taking account of the particular circumstances.
My view of Ms B’s complaint is that it isn’t so much about the solar panels themselves but 
that she was led to believe that they would be self-funding. In a situation like this, I wouldn’t 
necessarily think that it would be fair and reasonable to require the removal of the solar 
panels from Ms B’s home. I would consider a fair outcome would be to put Ms B in a position 
where the solar panels are self-funding over the original term of the loan.
But, in the particular circumstances of this complaint, I’m not satisfied that this would be fair. 
The solar panels are no longer installed, and Ms B isn’t receiving any benefit by way of FIT 
or savings from them. I accept that G has offered to reinstall the panels for Ms B at a later 
date, but she is currently in rented accommodation and therefore unable to have the panels 
reinstalled. And even if she were to have them reinstalled, she would no longer be able to 
receive FIT payments. My understanding is that as she had previously registered for FIT 
payments at a previous address, she would be unable to reregister at a new address. And G 
explained this to her before it removed the panels.
I’ve considered Creation’s position that it was Ms B’s choice to have the panels removed 
from her previous home. It’s suggested that Ms B could’ve arranged for her ex-husband to 
settle the loan agreement or she could have arranged for him to pay the benefits to her. But 
this isn’t what happened, and my understanding is that the divorce wasn’t amicable, so Ms B 
felt she had no choice but to pay G to remove the panels.   
Therefore, I’ve thought carefully on what I consider to be a fair and reasonable outcome in 
the particular circumstances of this complaint. The current situation is that the solar panels 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9221681
--------------------------

4
are in storage and have been so for the last two years. During this time Ms B hasn’t received 
any benefits from the solar panels and has fallen into arrears with her loan agreement. And 
as I’ve explained above, even if at some point in the future Ms B was able to have the panels 
reinstalled, she would no longer be able to receive FIT payments. 
I’ve also considered that the solar panels have already been removed from Ms B’s previous 
home, and my understanding is that she paid G a fee of around £500 to do this. This amount 
is significantly lower than what I have seen on similar cases where a finance provider has 
paid for solar panel systems to be removed. So, I’ve taken into account that Creation 
wouldn’t have to arrange for the solar panels to be removed or be required to make good 
any damage to the roof when deciding what I think is fair compensation in this case. 
Taking everything I’ve set out above, I think the fair and reasonable outcome, in the 
particular circumstances of this complaint, would be for Creation to put Ms B back in the 
position she would have been in if there had been no misrepresentation. And I am of the 
opinion that if it wasn’t for the misrepresentation that the solar panel system would be self-
funding and come at no additional financial cost to her, Ms B wouldn’t have agreed to have 
them installed and enter into the finance agreement.
This means, to put Ms B back in the position she would have been in, Creation should 
unwind the loan agreement, refund any monthly payments Ms B has made and remove any 
record of the loan agreement from her credit file. As Ms B also wouldn’t have also incurred 
the additional expense of paying G to remove the solar panels from her previous home, I’m 
satisfied that Creation should also refund this amount to her. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against Creation Consumer Finance Ltd. In 
full and final settlement of it, I require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:
(a) unwind the loan agreement,
(b) refund the monthly repayment Ms B has made, minus any benefits she has received 
from the solar panels,
(c) add 8% simple interest* a year to each refunded sum from the date each payment 
was made to the date of settlement,
(d) arrange for the removal of any records of the loan from any external credit records for 
Ms B, and;
(e) refund Ms B the money she paid to have the solar panels removed, adding 8% 
simple interest* a year from the date of payment to the date of settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 January 2020.

Complaint
Mr F is unhappy with the response from Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), 
following his claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
Background
In April 2015, My Planet, a company that supplied and installed solar panel systems knocked 
on Mr F’s door. Following a meeting at his home with a salesperson, Mr F agreed to enter 
into a contract with My Planet for it to supply and install a solar panel system costing about 
£10,000. To fund this he also agreed to enter into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation.
After the salesperson had left his home, Mr F called My Planet’s head office to cancel the 
solar panels. The following day the salesperson visited Mr F again to discuss why he had 
decided to cancel. At this point Mr F entered into a ‘buy now, pay later’ (‘BNPL’) agreement 
with Creation. This meant he had six months to repay the cost of the solar panels without 
incurring any interest. If he didn’t repay the amount within six months, he would then have to 
pay the amount borrowed, plus interest, over five years. Mr F said he tried to cancel the 
solar panel system before it was installed but was told by My Planet that he couldn’t. The 
solar panels were installed soon after.
In September 2015, Mr F made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the CCA to Creation. He 
said that My Planet had told him that the solar panels would be ‘self-funded’ and that the 
monthly loan payments would be more than off-set by the feed-in-tariff (‘FIT’) income and 
savings generated. But that didn’t look like it would happen. Instead, his monthly loan 
repayments were due to be much higher than the FIT income and savings generated.
Whilst Creation looked into his complaint Mr F made one payment towards the loan and then 
fell behind with his repayments. The account has been in arrears since.
In February 2016 Creation sent its final response letter to Mr F’s complaint. It said didn’t 
uphold the complaint as it didn’t think the solar panels had been mis-sold. It asked Mr F to 
contact it to arrange a payment plan.
In May 2016 Mr F, via his representative wrote to Creation again explaining why he felt the 
solar panel system had been mis-sold, including whether the original loan was affordable. 
Creation referred back to its final response letter from February 2016.
As he remained unhappy, Mr F, via his representative, referred his complaint to this Service. 
Whilst this Service was looking into the complaint, Creation offered to reduce the loan 
balance by 40%. 
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. She was satisfied that Mr F had 
decided to go ahead and purchase the solar panel system as he had been led to believe it 
would be ‘self-funded’. She also thought that the loan was affordable at the time it was taken 
out. But due to a change in Mr F’s personal circumstances, soon after the loan was taken 
out, he was unable to work. To put things right she thought Creation should arrive at a 
reasonable estimate of the potential savings and income to Mr F from the panels over the 
term of the loan and rework the loan such that he’d pay no more than that amount over the 
term. She also said that Creation should arrange a payment plan with Mr F to repay any 
outstanding balance.

Creation didn’t agree with our investigators view. In summary, it said:

It wasn’t clear over what term Mr F was told that the solar panels would be ‘self-
funding’ and it thought the BNPL period should be taken into account.

There was no evidence that Mr F had wished to cancel the solar panels and 
associated loan agreement.
Mr F, via his representative, didn’t accept what our investigator had said. He raised some 
concerns that the solar panels were installed within 14 days of Mr F signing the contract and 
he therefore wasn’t able to exercise his rights to cancel them.
I wrote to Creation and Mr F, via his representative, before I reached my final decision. I 
explained that based on what I had reviewed in the file I was satisfied that Mr F had decided 
to purchase the solar panel system on the basis that it would be self-funding. And therefore I 
thought a fair resolution would be for Creation to work out the potential savings and income 
to Mr F from the panels over the five year term of the loan and rework the loan so that he 
pays no more than that amount over five years; and he would keep the solar panels.
I also thought Creation should pay Mr F £100 for the trouble and upset caused. This was 
because the Renewable Energy Consumer Code, which administers the renewable energy 
consumer Code and ensures its members comply with the Code, had determined that My 
Planet had breached a number of sections of the Code. And because of this I was satisfied 
that Creation should’ve taken this information, available in the public domain, into account 
when reviewing Mr F’s complaint. I was of the opinion that this supported Mr F’s claim 
against Creation and it should have upheld his complaint sooner than it did.
Creation wrote back. It accepted that it should make the panels self-funding. However, it 
thought the BNPL period should be included and proposed to make the panels self-funding 
over five and a half years. It also agreed to pay Mr F £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
Mr F wrote back via his representative. He had nothing further to add.
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think Creation should take further steps to resolve this complaint.
Mr F has said he was approached by a salesperson from My Planet. And during the 
subsequent sales meeting he was told that the solar panel system would be entirely self-
financing and come at no additional cost to him. I haven’t seen anything to suggest that Mr F 
had shown a previous interest in solar panels before he was approached by My Planet. It is 
difficult to see why he would have agreed to the installation of the solar panels financed 
through a loan that would increase his monthly outgoings. Therefore, I think it’s unlikely that 
Mr F would’ve agreed to install the solar panel system and take a loan with Creation unless 
he was led to believe that it would be self-funding and come at no additional financial cost to 
him.
Mr F said after the salesperson had left his home he contacted My Planet to cancel the 
contract. And after he did this the same salesperson came to his home to ask why he had 
decided to cancel the contract. During this second conversation Mr F has said he was

pressurised into taking out a BNPL finance agreement through Creation. This is supported 
by screenshots Creation has provided. They show that the original loan agreement, taken 
out on 15 April 2015 was cancelled and superseded by the BNPL agreement two days later. 
The solar panels were installed six days later and at this point Mr F signed a satisfaction 
note, giving Creation authority to release the funds to My Planet.
Mr F has said he tried to cancel the solar panels before they were fitted but My Planet told 
him that he was unable to. And his representative has said that as they were fitted within the 
14 days cooling off period, Mr F was denied the opportunity to exercise his legal rights and 
cancel the loan agreement.
I’ve thought carefully on this point. Section 67 of the CCA sets out that a consumer is entitled 
to cancel a regulated agreement. But it goes on to say that this section does not apply if 
Section 66A (‘s66A’) does. And in Mr F’s case s66A does. This section allows a consumer to 
withdraw from a credit agreement. By withdrawing from the loan agreement with Creation he 
still would have had his contract with My Planet to supply and install the solar panels. And 
Mr F would have had to have arranged another way to finance the solar panels. 
So Mr F didn’t have any rights to cancel the loan agreement, he could’ve only withdrawn 
from it. And he still would’ve been left with solar panels that he would have needed to pay 
for.
Mr F has said that he had concerns that the loan wasn’t affordable to him and this was one 
of the key reasons why he looked to cancel the solar panels. There is very little information 
available about how Mr F’s financial situation was assessed when applying for the loan. 
Creation’s records show that Mr F had an income of between £30,000 and £39,900 when 
the loan was taken out. Mr F disagrees with this and says his income was around £20,000. 
He has provided bank statements which support this.
At the time the loan was taken out Creation carried out a credit check on Mr F. The only 
information showing on here was a mortgage and a current account. Taking into account 
utility bills this meant Mr F had outgoings of around £500 a month. Based on an income of 
£20,000 this meant Mr F had a disposable income of around £900 a month, compared to 
loan repayments of £262 a month. So I’m satisfied that at the time the loan was taken out 
there wasn’t anything to suggest that the loan was unaffordable or that Mr F wouldn’t be able 
to meet his contractual monthly payments.
I’m of the opinion that for the solar panels to be self-funding and come at no additional cost 
to Mr F, the savings and income he would receive should have been sufficient to cover the 
repayments due under the loan agreement.
To clarify, Mr F’s expected savings and incomes from the solar panels are from:
(1) generation income tariff,
(2) export tariff income, and;
(3) savings to Mr F by using the electricity generated by the panels instead of buying it 
from his energy provider.
Based on the figures I’ve seen the total expected return from the above three items, in the 
first year, would have come to £509 whereas the loan repayments were about £3,150 a 
year.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9228742
--------------------------

Taking this into account Mr F was likely to be out of pocket by about £2,640 in the first year. 
And that would have broadly been the same during the term of the loan. This means that 
based on this estimate the solar panels weren’t self-funding. So I’m satisfied that My Planet 
misrepresented the benefits to Mr F.
Mr F didn’t have any prior experience of the solar panel system and he was approached by 
My Planet. I’m satisfied that Mr F decided to go ahead with the purchase of the solar panel 
system based on the representations made by My Planet that the system would be self-
funding. 
For the reasons, I’ve explained above, I find that Mr F has suffered a loss as a result of the 
misrepresentation made by My Planet. The system wasn’t self-funding and Mr F ended up 
paying a significant amount over the savings. And as Creation has equal liability for the 
misrepresentation made by My Planet, I find that it is responsible for Mr F’s loss.
My view of Mr F’s complaint is that it isn’t so much about the solar panels themselves but 
that he was led to believe that they would be self-funding. Based on this I don’t think it would 
be fair or reasonable to require the removal of the solar panels from his home. And it is also 
accepted that it would cost Creation a significant sum to remove them from his home. So I 
don’t think it would be fair or reasonable to ask it to do that. Rather, I think the fair outcome 
here is to put Mr F in a position where the panels are self-funding over the original term of 
the loan. By allowing Mr F to keep the panels, he will likely benefit from lower electricity bills 
or FIT payments going forward.
In cases like this I would expect Creation to apply the methodology that is has agreed with 
our service. To confirm, its calculation should be based on the actual performance and 
estimated future performance of Mr F’s solar panel system.
There will be a number of assumptions used when calculating the estimated future 
performance. These include a self-consumption rate of 37%. Based on the Energy Savings 
Trust’s data I’m satisfied that this is reasonable. I think this as it would take into account 
changing consumer occupancy habits over the lifetime of the solar panel system and once 
the loan has been repaid Mr F will continue to likely benefit from the system via lower 
electricity bills or FIT payments.
I’ve also considered the other assumptions Creation has used such as the electricity price 
inflation, the degradation rate and the estimated retail price index (‘RPI’). I’m of the view that 
they don’t seem unreasonable taking into account the actual known figures. As an example 
the actual average RPI for the last 4 years doesn’t seem to be far from the assumed figure.
Creation has accepted this. Although it believes that the six month BNPL window should be 
taken into account when working out the original term of the loan. It has said this because Mr 
F would’ve been in receipt of savings and income from the solar panel system during this 
period and the BNPL in essence included a six months deferred payments.
I’ve taken on board Creation’s comments. And having done so, I remain of the view that the 
self-funding should be worked out over the five year term of the loan. I’ve looked at the loan 
agreement Mr F signed. This sets out the total amount payable in either a lump sum, 
payable within six months of the start of the agreement, or by making 60 monthly payments 
of £262.62. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9228742
--------------------------

5
Taking this into account the agreement that Mr F signed was for five year loan. I accept that 
he could have repaid the amount borrowed in the first six months without incurring any 
interest. But this isn’t what happened. And I can only base my decision on how to put things 
right based on what did happen, not what might have happened. 
I’ve also considered any ongoing maintenance costs for Mr F by keeping the solar panels. 
I’ve looked at the information available from the Energy Savings Trust. It says that solar 
panels don’t need a lot of maintenance but usually the inverter would need replacing 
‘sometime’ during the lifetime of the panels at a current cost of about £800. So I accept that 
Mr F could have some maintenance costs over the lifetime of the solar panels. I also accept 
that Mr F would likely have some benefit by way of savings and FIT income going forward.
It’s impossible to know what the extent of those costs and the benefits would actually be. 
However, based on the available information I think that the potential benefit should be 
adequate to offset any reasonable maintenance costs.
I remain of the view that Creation should pay Mr F £100 to recognise the trouble and upset 
caused. This is for the reasons I have explained above that I am satisfied that there was 
enough information in the public domain Creation should have taken into account when 
reviewing Mr F’s complaint. And if it had done this, it would have likely upheld his complaint 
sooner. 
In summary, to put things right Creation should recalculate the original loan based on the 
known and assumed savings and income to Mr F form the solar panels over the five year 
term of the loan so he pays no more than that, and he keeps the solar panel system. 
Normally, by recalculating the loan this way, Mr F’s monthly repayments would reduce, 
meaning that he would’ve paid more each month than he should’ve done resulting in an 
overpayment balance. And as a consumer would have been deprived of the monthly 
overpayment I would expect a business to add 8% simple interest from the date of the 
overpayment to the date of settlement. So normally, in a case like this, I think the fairest 
resolution would be to let a consumer have the following selection of options as to how they 
would like their overpayments to be used:
(a) the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and they 
continue to make their current monthly payment resulting in the loan finishing early,
(b) the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and they 
pay a new monthly payment until the end of the loan term,
(c) the overpayments are returned to the consumer and they continue to make their 
current monthly payment resulting in their loan finishing early, or
(d) the overpayments are returned to the consumer and they pay a new monthly 
payment until the end of the loan term.
However, this isn’t the situation in Mr F’s complaint. I was sorry to hear of the change in his 
circumstances soon after the loan was taken out. And because of this Mr F has only been 
able to make one payment towards the outstanding balance of his loan. I’ve seen that 
Creation has made attempts to discuss this and agree a way forward with Mr F and his 
representatives but hasn’t been successful.
I therefore, think that Creation should recalculate the original loan as described above. 
Where possible it should use Mr F’s actual electricity bills and FIT statements. It should then 
work with Mr F and his representative to reach an affordable repayment moving forward.

My final decision
My final decision is that Mr F’s complaint should be upheld. In full and final settlement of it, 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:
(a) allow Mr F to keep the solar panels,
(b) estimate the potential savings and incomes to Mr F from the panels over the five year 
term of the loan and rework it so he pays no more than this. Where possible, it 
should use Mr F’s electricity bills and FIT statements to do this,
(c) add 8% simple interest* to any overpayment made from the date the overpayment 
was made to date of settlement,
(d) pay Mr F £100 for the trouble and upset caused; and 
(e) work with Mr F and his representative to agree an affordable repayment plan moving 
forward.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2019.

*If Creation Consumer Finance Ltd considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr F how much it’s taken off. It should 
also give Mr F a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so he can claim the tax from HM 
Revenue & Customs.

complaint
Mr T complains about a car bought with a loan from Creation Consumer Finance Limited 
(“CCFL”). He says that the car was not fit for purpose. He brings this complaint under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
background
Mr T bought a car with a loan from CCFL in November 2011. Within five days of purchase he 
complained to the dealership about the car juddering. The dealership supplied new spark 
plugs and coil packs to repair the fault, but Mr T continued to complain about the juddering 
and the car was returned for investigation into the juddering and repair in February, March, 
October and November 2012, and again in June 2013 and January 2014. The dealership 
believed that the juddering had been fixed by the repairs in March 2012, and that the 
juddering experienced in October 2012 onwards was due to a different fault which was not 
present at the point of sale.
An independent inspection report obtained by CCFL in January 2014 concluded that there 
was a slight “tizzing” for two seconds after starting the car from cold, but this was acceptable 
given the age and mileage of the car. It also said that the fault was not present at point of 
sale. 
Mr T disagreed with the report and said that the juddering lasted about 20 seconds. He 
asked an engineer who was employed by a dealer for his make of car, to inspect the car in 
January 2014. The engineer suggested that the juddering was due to an issue with the 
cylinders which he would not normally expect to see in a car of this age and mileage, and 
suggested a new engine was likely to be required. He could not say without further 
investigation whether the issue was present at point of sale. 
The independent inspector did not agree that a replacement engine was required. He said 
that if there was an issue with the cylinders at the point of sale, he would have expected their 
condition to have deteriorated so that it became apparent, given the mileage covered by
Mr T. But he also suggested further investigation.
Mr T has lost faith in the car and the dealership, and wishes to reject the car and cancel the 
finance and obtain a refund of all his payments. 
The adjudicator noted that CCFL maintained that the car was of satisfactory quality at the 
point of sale. But, based on all the evidence she had received, she considered it was more 
likely that there was an issue with the car at the time of purchase, and that it was not of 
satisfactory quality. She recommended that CCFL should:-
 - Allow Mr T to reject the car. It should then be collected at no cost to him.
 - Refund any cash deposit paid. It appeared this was £200.
 - Remove any remaining loan balance, including interest, associated with the purchase of 
the vehicle. But Mr T would still be liable to repay the negative equity amount of £4,169.13 
from a previous loan. CCFL should also liaise with Mr T to agree a repayment plan for this 
sum.
 - Update the credit reference agencies accordingly.
 - Refund Mr T for the diagnostic checks he had arranged.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9264156
--------------------------

2
 - Refund 10% of any instalments paid by Mr T as he has had some loss of use and loss of 
enjoyment from the car.
All refunds should include interest of 8% simple per annum from the date of payment to the 
date of settlement.
CCFL disagreed and responded to say, in summary, that a slight vibration was a normal 
occurrence for the car’s engine type and that the car would have already failed if there was 
an inherent fault in view of the mileage driven.
Mr T disagreed and said that the return of the £200 deposit and the refund of 10% of the 
loan payment was not sufficient to compensate him for his inconvenience and time spent on 
the matter.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here), 
I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities – in other words, what I consider is most 
likely to have happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
I can see that the juddering problems arose in the car very soon after purchase and that they 
have continued. Mr T has had to return the car to be investigated and/or repaired on 
numerous occasions and has suffered inconvenience as a result. But I can see that he has 
otherwise been able to use the car and has driven over 22,000 miles in it.
The dealership believed that its repairs in March 2012 rectified the juddering as Mr T did not 
complain about the juddering again until some seven months later. I note that CCFL 
considers that the later juddering was due to a different cause which was not present at the 
point of sale.
I also note that Mr T’s engineer, a specialist for Mr T’s make of car, said in both June 2013 
and January 2014 that there were problems with the cylinders , albeit different ones, and on 
both occasions suggested that a new engine would be required. There was also low 
compression in January 2014. I can also see that there was a problem with one of the 
cylinders and inconsistences with compression in October 2012. A stripping down of the 
engine to investigate the cause of the problem was recommended in June 2013, but never 
carried out.
The opinions of both independent engineers differ, but both have recommended further 
investigation to ascertain whether the fault was present at point of sale. 
CCFL said that slight vibration was normal for the type of the engine in the car, but I note 
that the dealership referred to severe vibration in its letter dated late June 2013.
In the absence of conclusive evidence that the car was of satisfactory quality at the point of 
sale, I have taken other evidence into account. In particular I note that the engine has never 
been stripped down to investigate the fault, as had been recommended. I also note the five 
occasions that it was necessary for Mr T to take his car back for investigation and/or repairs 
Ref:

--------------------------

due to the juddering within four months of purchase. And then the same fault became 
apparent seven months later, and again in 2013 and 2014. 
I also note that Mr T did not feel safe in the car and I can also see that he had lost 
confidence in the dealership after it had failed to remedy the juddering following at least eight 
repair attempts.
Like the adjudicator and, on balance, I consider it more likely than not that the car was not of 
satisfactory quality when supplied. It is clear that Mr T lacks confidence in both the car and 
the dealership’s ability to repair the car due to its previous repair history. So, I am satisfied 
that it is fair and reasonable that Mr T should be permitted to cancel the loan agreement and 
return the car. 
I note that Mr T has driven over 22,000 miles in the car and the faults have limited his 
enjoyment of it. But, I agree with the adjudicator that a refund of his deposit and 10% of each 
monthly instalment to take account of Mr T’s loss of use and enjoyment is reasonable in the 
circumstances. I also agree with the other elements of the redress recommend by the 
adjudicator. 
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of it, I order 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited to:-
1.
Arrange for the collection of the car and cancel the remaining finance at no additional 
cost to Mr T. But Mr T is still liable to repay the negative equity amount of £4,169.13 
from a previous loan. CCFL should liaise with Mr T to agree a repayment plan for this 
sum.
2.
Refund Mr T’s deposit of £200 in full. Interest should be calculated on this amount at 
8% simple per annum from the date of Mr T’s deposit payment to the date of 
settlement;
3.
Refund 10% of each monthly instalment that Mr T has paid under the loan 
agreement. Interest should be calculated on these amounts at 8% simple per annum 
from the date of each payment to the date of settlement; 
4.
Refund the cost of any diagnostic reports paid by Mr T upon presentation of a 
receipt; and
5.
Remove the information about the November 2011 loan agreement from Mr T’s credit 
file. 
If CCFL considers that tax should be deducted from the interest element of my award, it 
should provide Mr T with the appropriate tax deduction certificate so that he is able to claim 
a refund, if appropriate.

complaint
Mr T says Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold an insurance policy to him. 
background
In 2008 Mr T took out a loan with Creation over the phone. At the same time Creation sold 
him a policy providing life, personal accident and hospitalisation cover. Mr T borrowed extra 
to pay for the policy, which was to be repaid – with interest – over the loan term.   
Our adjudicator upheld Mr T’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had made Mr T clearly 
aware that the policy wouldn’t cover the full loan term, or how much it cost compared to the 
benefit he might get back. And she didn’t think Mr T would have bought the policy if he’d 
known these things.
Creation said it was Mr T’s responsibility to read the information it gave him and ask 
questions if anything wasn’t clear. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy Mr T bought wasn’t a traditional payment protection insurance (PPI) policy, as it 
didn’t give unemployment or sickness cover. But I think the relevant issues to take into 
account are materially the same as our well-established approach to PPI complaints, which 
is published on our website. So I’ve kept that in mind when looking at Mr T’s complaint.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr T’s complaint.
Creation sold the policy to Mr T over the phone. It hasn’t got a copy of the call recording. But 
it’s provided a call script it says would have been followed. Looking at that script, and the 
paperwork Creation says it sent to Mr T after the call, I have concerns about whether Mr T 
would have understood that he had a choice about buying the policy. But I also share the 
adjudicator’s concerns about how the policy was explained to Mr T; particularly the cost of it 
compared to the level of benefit it might give him. 
The policy cost over £3,500. Around £1,100 of that was interest on the single premium. But 
the script doesn’t suggest that Mr T would have been given either the single premium cost or 
the interest figure over the phone. And the interest also wasn’t shown separately in the loan 
agreement he received afterwards. 
Creation says the interest was given separately in the ‘statement of price’, which was 
included in the policy summary it says would have been sent to Mr T. But I can’t be sure 
Mr T did get that document. And even if he did, I’m not satisfied he would have known he 
should look at page two of the policy summary to find important information about the cost of 
the policy. That wasn’t a prominent location, or where Mr T would reasonably expect to find 
it. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the policy to be in 
the loan agreement.  
Mr T initially borrowed £10,600 (excluding the cost of the policy). If he died the policy would 
pay off the outstanding loan balance. If he had an accident which led to the loss of a limb, or 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9278718
--------------------------

2
the loss of sight in an eye, the policy would pay £2,000. Cover under that part of the policy 
would then end. Otherwise it offered a daily benefit (paid monthly) if Mr T was in hospital for 
more than 5 days in a row (to a maximum of 12 months benefit per claim). 
The circumstances in which the policy would pay benefit were therefore limited. And the 
policy also only provided cover for 60 months, when the loan was for 84 months. That also 
wasn’t clear in the call script. And, whilst it was in the policy summary, again it wasn’t 
prominent.
To make back the cost of the policy Mr T would have to claim for over 15 months under the 
hospitalisation benefit – or claim under the personal accident cover and also successfully 
claim for several months under the hospitalisation cover. The likelihood of him doing that 
was remote. I’ve taken the life cover into consideration, but it seems that was of little use to 
Mr T, given his circumstances. 
It was Creation’s responsibility to give Mr T enough information about the main features and 
benefits of the policy to enable him to decide whether the policy was right for him. Creation 
should have ensured his attention was drawn to the important information about the policy 
which would be likely to affect his decision making. I’m not satisfied that Creation met its 
responsibility to give Mr T enough information to make an informed choice. 
I have no reason to doubt that the cost of the policy would have been important to Mr T. 
Given the relatively limited cover the policy offered compared to the cost of it, I don’t think he 
would have seen the policy as offering any real value to him if he’d properly understood the 
cost of it. So I’m not persuaded he would have bought it if not for Creation’s failings.
what Creation should do to put things right
Mr T borrowed extra to pay for the policy, so his loan is bigger than it should’ve been. And 
he’s been paying more than he should’ve each month. So Mr T needs to get back the extra 
he’s paid and start paying what he should’ve been paying all along. 
So Creation should:

Change the amount Mr T has left to pay on the loan so his payments are the same as 
they would be without the policy.

Work out and pay Mr T the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without the policy.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr T paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.

complaint
Mr C complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd took payment from his account even 
though he had returned the item the agreement related to. He also complains that Creation 
did not provide him with the service it should have once he had raised his complaint.
background
Mr C entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation in February 2016 to acquire an 
item. However when the item was delivered it was not fit for purpose and so he rejected it. 
He says the retailer told him that his direct debit had been cancelled and no payment would 
be taken. Mr C says he checked his account for the following two months and no payment 
was taken and so he thought the issue had been resolved. However he then found out that 
his account had been placed on hold after which payments were taken totalling over £320.
Creation says that Mr C signed an agreement to acquire an item at the retailer’s store and 
that this included a direct debit mandate. It says it received notification from the retailer that 
the item had been delivered on 3 May 2016. It says it was not aware that Mr C did not have 
the item until he contacted it on 5 June 2017. Creation says that it contacted the retailer to 
say the agreement was still live and that it hadn’t received any cancellation request. 
Following this Mr C’s agreement was cancelled on 15 June and a refund for the payments 
he had made was issued on the same day. It also said that it would remove this agreement 
from Mr C’s credit file.
Our investigator did not think that Creation had done anything wrong and so he did not 
recommend that this complaint be upheld.
Mr C did not accept our investigator’s view. He said that the issues he experienced were due 
to faults by both Creation and the retailer and that both parties should be considered in the 
complaint. He said that the retailer put his account on hold for the first three months and so 
as no payments were taken at that time he thought there was no issue with his rejection of 
the item. He said that he didn’t receive any notification from Creation that it was going to 
start taking payments and wanted to know what confirmation Creation received from the 
retailer about the goods being accepted before payments were taken.
Mr C was also upset by the service he received from Creation when he raised the issue with 
him. He said he was required to prove everything he said and that the relatively short 
timescale to resolution was due to him and not Creation which he said were unhelpful. Mr C 
also said that he should not have had to deal with an arrears issue give the situation on his 
account.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr C is upset by what has happened since he rejected the item he 
acquired from the retailer. I appreciate that Mr C wants us to look into both the actions of the 
retailer and the actions of Creation. The retailer acted as a credit broker for the agreement 
and so its role as a credit broker can be considered, however we cannot consider the wider 
service it provided.

This decision relates to the actions of Creation and assesses whether or not it did anything 
wrong and, if so, what it needs to do to put this right. My role is not to punish Creation but if a 
mistake has been made to ensure that Mr C is put back in the position he would have been 
had this not happened.
In this case Mr C rejected an item and was told that his agreement had been cancelled. 
Unfortunately, the retailer did not tell Creation that the agreement had been cancelled. 
Because of this the agreement remained live until Mr C contacted Creation to explain the 
issue.
Mr C has asked for an explanation about what information Creation received from the retailer 
to start the payments and why he did not receive notification that payments were about to 
commence. He has also asked for information about why his account was put on hold. 
Creation has provided a screen shot showing that it received an automatic confirmation from 
the retailer on 3 May that the item had been delivered. It said that it usually takes payments 
four weeks after this confirmation is received. In this case it has explained that on 13 May a 
three month payment break was applied to Mr C’s account. It said this happened as the 
retailer requested the agreement be cancelled but that it was told the retailer would need to 
cancel the agreement. The hold was applied at the retailer’s request.
Based on the information received from Creation, it appears that the process for cancelling 
the agreement was not completed correctly by the retailer during the three month period. 
Because of this payments then commenced. While I can see why payments commenced 
given the notification Creation had received in regard to the agreement cancellation I think it 
could have done more to assist in this process.
Once Creation was made aware that Mr C did not have the item it contacted the retailer and 
the agreement was cancelled within 10 days of Mr C’s first contact. I find this was a 
reasonably timely response to the issue. At this time the payments Mr C had made under the 
agreement were also refunded and Creation said that Mr C’s credit file would be amended to 
remove the agreement. Again I find this reasonable. 
Mr C has said his account went overdrawn while these payments were being taken and that 
he incurred charges. I note that in the letter from the retailer to Mr C dated 14 August 2017, 
the retailer apologised for the inconvenience caused by the payments being taken from Mr C 
and offered to pay him £50 as a gesture of goodwill. It also said that if Mr C provided 
evidence of the charges he had incurred due to payments being taken from his account it 
could consider these. As I have not seen any evidence of the charges Mr C incurred, I have 
not been able to consider these further.
Mr C has complained about the service he received through this process including the fact 
that he was chased for payment after cancelling his direct debit and told a charge would be 
applied for arrears on his account. I have looked through Mr C’s timeline of events following 
his initial contact with Creation. I understand why Mr C was upset that he was told the 
agreement could not be cancelled until the retailer had contacted Creation about this and 
that Creation would not contact the store but that Mr C needed to do this. 
I also understand why Mr C was upset about the contact he received about his account 
being in arrears. I appreciate that this was process was triggered by Mr C cancelling his 
direct debit. However, given the complaint Mr C had raised about his payment being wrongly 
debited I think that Creation could have done more to prevent him being contacted about 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9294022
--------------------------

3
arrears until it was clear on what needed to happen with is agreement. I do however accept 
that this issue was resolved quickly.
Overall, while I can see why Mr C has been upset by this process, I find that the actions 
taken by Creation have put him back in the position he would have been had the agreement 
been cancelled when it should have been. I think that Creation could have provided Mr C 
with better service but the issues have arisen due to the retailer not properly cancelling the 
agreement and Creation acted in a timely way once it was aware of the situation.
Creation has discussed compensation with the retailer and has said that the retailer has 
agreed to pay Mr C £250 compensation for the trouble and upset he has been caused. 
Creation has also said that in the event the retailer fails to pay the £250 to Mr C it will make 
the payment. Again I find this a fair response to this complaint.
Mr C has been informed of the compensation offer.
my final decision
My final decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should ensure that Mr C is paid 
compensation of £250 for the trouble and upset he has been caused. In the event this is not 
paid by the retailer, Creation should pay this amount to Mr C. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2018.

complaint
Ms C complains that it was unfair for Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to expect her to pay 
the interest on a loan.
background
In 2014 Ms C took the loan out to buy some furniture. She paid a deposit, and then the loan 
agreement gave her two choices about paying the balance. She could either make monthly 
payments for three years starting in March 2015. In that case she would pay a total of over 
£10,000 (including interest) in further payments. Or (as a special offer) she could simply 
make one payment of £5,437 by 23 February 2015, thus not paying any interest at all. The 
business which had sold the furniture had arranged for an upholsterer to visit in March 2015 
to deal with concerns Ms C had about it. On 21 February Ms C rang Creation to ask how 
much interest would be payable if she did not pay until March (after the upholsterer’s visit). 
She was dissatisfied when told it was the full amount of interest and asked to escalate 
matters. She says she asked for a call back before the payment date. But the call back did 
not happen until 24 February, when she was told she now needed to pay all the interest. She 
does not think that is fair or reasonable in the circumstances. After she complained, Creation 
said that the decision about the interest could not be changed, but it gave her a figure to 
settle the loan at that point.
Our adjudicator did not recommend that the complaint was upheld. He said that Creation 
had always clearly and consistently said the agreement must be settled by 23 February 2015 
for the interest to be waived. It had said that in the agreement, a reminder letter sent in 
January 2015 and when Ms C rang in February 2015. Although Creation’s usual timescale 
for a call back was 24 hours, he did not think the delay had been unreasonable.
Ms C disagreed. She said that, if Creation had called her back before the due date, she 
would have paid the lump sum to avoid paying interest. She suggested that Creation had 
deliberately delayed calling her so she would be liable for the interest. She should not be 
penalised by having to pay the interest because of Creation’s poor customer service. She 
indicated that she might wish to pursue a court claim against Creation if her complaint was 
not upheld.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that it would be annoying for Ms C to have to wait longer than expected for a call 
back. But in the original call on 21 February she had already been given a reasonable 
answer to her query – that she would need to pay all the interest if she did not pay in full by 
23 February. I appreciate that she was hoping for a different answer so asked for a call back 
to escalate matters: but Creation had already stated its position, which was justified. I can 
understand why Ms C might have preferred to wait until the issue with the furniture was 
resolved, but Creation was entitled to expect her to stick to the terms of the agreement.   
Although Creation should have rung back sooner, when there was a significant amount extra 
to pay if she waited until after 23 February, I might have expected Ms C to ring Creation 
again on 22 or 23 February to pursue matters: but I have seen nothing to suggest that she 
did. I do not think Ms C could reasonably rely on Creation changing its position and agreeing

DRN9347987
--------------------------

2
to allow her to wait longer to pay in full - either because of the issue with the furniture or 
because of the delay in the call back. 
Overall I cannot see that the delayed call back, or the other circumstances, provide grounds 
for me to say that Creation should not expect Ms C to pay interest in line with the terms of 
the agreement. I know that will disappoint Ms C, but she does not have to accept my 
decision. It is open to her to pursue matters in court instead if she wishes.
my final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2016.

complaint
Mr E complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (Creation) mis-sold a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy to him.
background
In 2005, Mr E bought some furniture in a shop and he took out a £2,149.00 loan to pay for it. 
At the same time Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £766.07, which was added 
to the loan and attracted interest. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr E wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise, he’d pay interest (including £683.12 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr E’s complaint. She didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And she didn’t think Mr E would have bought the policy if it 
had done so. Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr E was 
given would have made him aware of what the policy cost.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr E’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr E how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But the credit 
agreement didn’t show the PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to 
expect Mr E to work out the interest himself. He was entitled to expect all the 
important information about the cost of the policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr E would expect it to be. And I can’t be 
sure it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his 
attention was on buying furniture – not on insurance.

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been 
good practice and might have helped Mr E to understand what the policy was costing 
him.

The information on the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr E aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t 
pay the loan off during the first 12 months, the whole amount, including the PPI, 
attracted interest at 29.8%. This meant Mr E would pay a substantial extra amount of 
interest on the PPI cost in the first year, when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ 
life cover.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9352780
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr E was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr E would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy.

I don’t think Mr E would have bought the policy if he’d been made properly aware of 
how much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons I uphold Mr E’s complaint.
fair compensation
Mr E borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been. He 
paid more than he should’ve each month and it cost him more to repay the loan than it 
would’ve. So he needs to get back the extra he’s paid.
So, Creation should:

Work out and pay Mr E the difference between what he paid each month on the loan 
and what he would’ve paid without PPI.  

Work out and pay the difference between what it cost to pay off the loan and what it 
would have cost to pay off the loan without PPI.
Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr E paid from when he paid it until he gets it back. 
The rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year from then on†. If Mr E made 
a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what he got for the claim from 
the amount it owes him.  † HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this 
interest. Creation must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if he asks 
for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’ve decided to uphold Mr E’s complaint. Under the rules of 
the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr E to accept or reject my decision 
before 2 March 2015.

complaint
Mrs R complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy when she took out a loan by telephone in 2005. The cost of the policy 
was added to the loan and repaid over the loan term.  
background
The adjudicator upheld the complaint. He didn’t think Creation had told Mrs R she had a 
choice about buying the policy. He also didn’t think it properly told her how much it would 
cost. The adjudicators didn’t think Mrs R would have bought the policy if she’d known these 
things.  
Creation disagreed. It said the sales script and loan agreement made clear the policy was 
optional. And the paperwork it sent to Mrs R also explained what the policy cost. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mrs R’s complaint, because:

Creation effectively sold the policy to Mrs R over the phone. So she would have relied 
more on what she was told during the call than on anything she got in writing afterwards. 
But Creation didn’t make clear during the telephone call that Mrs R had a choice about 
buying the policy. 

The script didn’t tell the call handler to clearly explain that the policy was optional, or get 
Mrs R’s consent to add it to her loan. Although the script said to give quotes ‘with and 
without’ PPI, it isn’t clear how they were explained, or what Mrs R was told.  

The brief mention of cancellation rights wasn’t enough to make Mrs R aware she had a 
choice about buying the policy. And it wouldn’t have given her the confidence to cancel 
the policy when Creation hadn’t first clearly told her she had a choice about whether to 
buy it.  

I can see that Mrs R ticked and signed for the PPI on the loan agreement. But that didn’t 
describe the PPI as optional. And by then the PPI looked like an integral part of the loan. 
The agreement didn’t say what would happen if Mrs R didn’t tick and sign. And although 
the very last sentence on the statement of price said it ‘wasn’t a requirement’ of the loan 
to buy the policy, this could be easily overlooked. 

The script didn’t properly disclose the policy costs. The credit agreement did set out the 
single premium and the total cost of the PPI. But it didn’t set out the interest as a 
separate figure. I don’t think it was reasonable to expect Mrs R to work out that figure for 
herself. She was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement. 
Ref:

DRN9368487


The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mrs R would expect it to be.   

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy either. This would have 
been good practice and it might have helped Mrs R to better understand what the policy 
was costing her.  

I don’t think Mrs R would have bought the policy if she’d been made properly aware she 
had a choice, or if she’d known how much it was going to cost her, compared to the 
amount of the loan and what she was paying for it. 
For these reasons, I uphold Mrs R’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mrs R should be put back in the position she would now be in if she’d taken out the loan 
without the PPI policy. I understand that the loan and PPI ran for their full term.
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mrs R because PPI was added 
to the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mrs R had taken out the 
loan without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mrs R actually paid, and paying her the difference; 
and

paying Mrs R simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mrs R setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mrs R needs to take any further action will depend on her financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mrs R should refer back to Creation if she’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mrs R 
and Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the 
tax treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs R’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay her the compensation 
I’ve described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2014.

complaint
Mrs K complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd has not acted positively and 
sympathetically towards her, after she experienced financial difficulties in repaying her debt. 
Mrs K complains that Creation has continued to add significant interest to her account and 
she is unable to reduce her debt.
background
Mrs K began to experience financial difficulties in 2006 and her account with Creation went 
into arrears. Mrs K asked a credit counselling service for help and a repayment plan was 
agreed, at a modest amount per month. Creation froze interest and charges on the account 
for two years, until late 2008.  
Mrs K’s financial difficulties were continuing and she maintained the agreed payments. But, 
she was not reducing her debt by any meaningful amount, because of the interest being 
added. In 2012 the interest rate applied to the account increased and Mrs K was in the 
position where her monthly repayments did not cover the interest being added. A new 
repayment plan was agreed and Mrs K is paying more to cover this interest increase.
The adjudicator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. She considered that 
Creation had not acted positively or sympathetically towards Mrs K and had not taken 
sufficient practical steps to help Mrs K manage her debt. She considered that the level of 
interest added to the account meant that the debt was never going to be significantly 
reduced. She recommended that Creation refund all interest applied to the account since 
late 2008, freeze all further interest and agree an affordable repayment plan until the debt is 
cleared.
Creation did not agree with the adjudicator’s conclusions and responded to say, in summary, 
that it had acted positively and sympathetically by agreeing a repayment plan to reduce the 
monthly payments and applying a reduced interest rate. 
 
my findings
I have considered everything that Mrs K and Creation have said and provided, in order to 
decide what is fair and reasonable in this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions of the adjudicator for broadly similar reasons.
When Mrs K first explained about her financial difficulties, interest was frozen on the account 
for two years. Although Mrs K was still having financial difficulties, interest was re-instated. It 
does not appear from the evidence I have seen, that Creation explored with Mrs K whether 
this was appropriate.
In 2012, interest was increased and Mrs K had to increase her monthly repayment. Creation 
has said that customers are told to get in touch, to arrange a new repayment plan, and Mrs 
K did not do so. I do not consider that this is enough. Creation was aware that Mrs K was in 
financial difficulties and should have done more to assist her.
Creation has continued to add interest to the account, at an amount which effectively 
perpetuates the debt. Despite making the agreed monthly repayments, Mrs K has reduced 
her debt by only £20.67 in the last four years. I consider that Creation has not treated Mrs K

positively and sympathetically and the steps it has taken have not helped Mrs K manage her 
debt.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of it, I order 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to do the following:
1.
Refund all interest added to the account since December 2008.
2.
Freeze all further interest on the account.
3.
Agree an affordable repayment plan, until the outstanding balance is cleared.

complaint
Miss G had an account with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd, and sent two cheques to it to 
clear an outstanding debt. She complains that Creation has not credited these cheques to 
her account, and is still pursuing her for payment of the debt. She wants the account to be 
recorded as paid.
background
Miss G told us that she supplied to Creation copies of the two cheques, and of her bank 
account statements. She said these showed the cheques had been cleared, and the money 
owed to Creation had been paid. The cheques were sent at the beginning and end of March 
2011.
Creation wrote to Miss G in January 2015, to say that it had been unable to locate these 
particular payments. She referred her complaint to us.
Our adjudicator thought her complaint should be upheld. He acknowledged that Miss G had 
not written her reference number on the back of one cheque, but felt it was reasonable to 
conclude that she did make the payments, and that Creation did receive the money.
Our adjudicator said it would have been reasonable for the cheques to have been traced – 
but this did not happen, and Creation had not treated Miss G fairly. He recommended that:

The cheques should be credited to her Creation account

Creation should remove any interest or other charges that had been applied to her 
account because the cheques had not been credited

Creation should also correct the information it had recorded on Miss G’s credit file, to 
reflect these payments being made in March and April 2011

Miss G should receive £100 in compensation for the trouble and upset caused by this 
matter
Creation accepted our adjudicator’s recommendations. Miss G did not, saying the 
compensation proposed was insufficient. She wanted £500, and asked for her complaint to 
be reviewed by an ombudsman.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I find that I have come to the same 
conclusion as our adjudicator, for the same reasons.
I sympathise with Miss G. This matter has been troubling and upsetting her for about four 
years, and has included dealing with debt collectors. She thinks that Creation should be 
punished both for its initial errors, and for allowing a long running dispute to develop.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9396148

2
But, as our adjudicator explained, the Financial Ombudsman Service is not a regulator. Our 
role is to achieve a fair and appropriate outcome to her complaint, rather than to punish. 
There is a technical note about trouble and upset on our public website, in which we 
describe:

how we decide whether to award compensation for distress, inconvenience, damage to 
reputation, pain and suffering

how we decide the amount to award, where compensation is appropriate

cases where we have awarded compensation
I feel that compensation of £100 in this instance (as recommended by our adjudicator) is 
appropriate, given the circumstances of Miss G’s complaint. It is consistent with our 
approach to awarding compensation, and with those case descriptions and awards.
my final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
should:
1.
Credit Miss G’s cheques to her Creation account
2.
Remove any interest or other charges that have been applied to her account because 
the cheques had not been credited
3.
Correct the information it has recorded on Miss G’s credit file, to reflect these payments 
being made in March and April 2011
4.
Pay £100 in compensation directly to Miss G for the trouble and upset caused by this 
matter
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 September 2015.

complaint
Miss H complains about the way Creation Consumer Finance Ltd handled a debt she owed 
them and about information they provided to credit reference agencies.
background
Miss H took out a finance agreement with Creation in June 2018 to pay for goods she 
bought from a retailer.
When signing up to the agreement, Miss H gave her postal address and her bank account 
details and agreed to set up a direct debit to make the regular payments.
Miss H says Creation set up the account against the wrong postal address. She says this led 
to the direct debit failing. She says she didn’t know about this until she was contacted by a 
debt collection agency in January 2019.
Miss H has now paid off the loan. But she’s unhappy Creation have reported her missed 
payments to credit reference agencies. She says this has affected her credit rating and led 
to other businesses suspending her accounts.
She’s also unhappy that Creation used the debt collection agency to try to retrieve the 
money.
Miss H complained to Creation. When they didn’t uphold her complaint, she brought it to us. 
Our investigator looked into it and didn’t think Creation had done anything wrong. 
Miss H disagreed and asked for a final decision from an ombudsman.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I’m not going to uphold it and I’ll explain 
why.
The direct debit Miss H originally set up to make the payments didn’t fail because she 
changed address. Creation have provided evidence they received an instruction from 
Miss H’s bank that the direct debit was cancelled – by Miss H. This meant they couldn’t 
collect the scheduled payments.
If Miss H didn’t instruct her bank to cancel the direct debit, then it appears they’ve made an 
error and she can make a complaint against them. But I can’t hold Creation responsible for 
any error Miss H’s bank may have made.
Miss H’s credit agreement requires her to notify Creation if she moves address – so that they 
can contact her if they need to. She didn’t do so. 
Creation have provided evidence that they sent several letters to the address Miss H 
provided and made several phone calls to the number she’d given them. They were hoping 
to inform her she wasn’t making the payments. They had no response to the letters, no 
returned mail and no answer or reply to their phone calls.

Miss H gave her new address as the delivery address for the goods she bought from the 
retailer. I’m satisfied, on that basis, she likely knew when signing the credit agreement – or 
very soon after that – that she was moving. And it would or should have occurred to her 
when she gave the delivery address that she’d given a different address in the credit 
agreement.
Miss H says the first she knew about her direct debit payments failing was when she was 
contacted by the debt collection agency – several months later. I assume she receives bank 
statements and/or can check her account on-line. It’s not unreasonable to say that she 
should have noticed the missed direct debit payments.
Miss H has objected to Creation referring her debt to the debt collection agency to trace her 
on Creation’s behalf. But Creation had a customer who owed them money who didn’t appear 
to be at the address she’d given them and wasn’t answering calls made to the number she’d 
given them. In the circumstances, I don’t think it was unreasonable for them to ask for 
assistance from a specialist agency.
After the agency contacted Miss H, Creation recalled the account from the agency and dealt 
with the matter themselves – which avoided further costs for Miss H. And meant she didn’t 
have to deal with the agency for any longer than was necessary.
Miss H did miss the payments Creation reported to the credit reference agencies. Creation 
are required to provide accurate credit reference information. I’m satisfied the missed 
payments weren’t due to any error on Creation’s part. And they are an accurate reflection of 
Miss H’s creditworthiness. I can’t say it’s unfair or unreasonable for Creation to report this 
information – or to decide not to remove it now.
Miss H has been represented in this complaint by a friend. He’s said we’ve not conducted a 
proper investigation because we haven’t checked that the signature on the credit agreement 
is Miss H’s. 
I should be absolutely clear that I’ve taken that into account in making my decision. When 
Miss H made her complaint to us, she said that she’d taken out the agreement with Creation 
and set up a direct debit - which she said had failed because of the change of address. 
She’s taken the goods provided by the retailer and she’s now settled the debt. 
I’m satisfied beyond any doubt at all that Miss H took out the agreement and owed the 
money to Creation. And there was absolutely no reason at all for us to question the signature 
on the credit agreement. 
my final decision
For the reasons set out above, I don’t uphold Miss H’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 December 2019.

Complaint
Miss B is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), 
following a claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974.
Background 
Miss B was contacted by a company, I’ll refer to it as ‘P’, that supplied and installed solar 
panel systems. Following a meeting at her home Miss B agreed to enter into a contract with 
P for it to supply and install a solar panel system costing around £9,300. To fund this Miss B 
also entered into a 10 year fixed sum loan agreement with Creation.
Miss B made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the CCA. She said that P had told her that 
the solar panel system would be ‘self-funded’ and that the monthly loan repayments would 
be more than off-set by the feed-in-tariff (‘FIT’) income. But that hadn’t happened. Instead, 
the monthly loan repayments had been much higher.
In its final response letter, Creation said that it didn’t think the benefits of the solar panels 
had been misrepresented. As a gesture of goodwill, it offered to reduce the total amount 
payable under the loan agreement by 25%. Unhappy with this response, Miss B referred the 
complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. She felt that the benefits of the 
solar panels had been mis-represented. In her latest view to both parties she recommended 
that Creation recalculate the potential savings and income from the solar panels to Miss B 
over the term of the loan. She said it should then restructure the loan so that Miss B would 
pay no more than this amount over the 10 year term of the loan. As this would mean that 
Miss B would have been paying more each month than she should’ve been our investigator 
also recommended it give Miss B the following four options as to how she would like her 
overpayments to be used:
1.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and 
Miss B continues to pay her current monthly loan repayment resulting in her loan 
finishing early,
2.
the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and 
she pays a new, lower monthly loan until the end of the loan term,
3.
the overpayments are returned to Miss B and she continues to pay her existing 
monthly loan repayment resulting in her loan finishing early, or;
4.
the overpayments are returned to Miss B and she pays a new, lower monthly 
loan repayment until the end of the loan term.
Our investigator also recommended that Creation pay Miss B £100 to recognise the trouble 
and upset caused.
Creation accepted our investigators view of the complaint. Miss B didn’t. In summary, she 
said:

she didn’t think the assumptions used by Creation were fair and she’d made her 
own detailed calculation which showed that Creation had over-estimated the 
potential income and benefits she would receive,
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9424698
--------------------------

2

she thought Creation should also make a payment to her for the cost of replacing 
the inverter as it was likely to need replacing during the lifetime of the solar panel 
system, and;

£100 didn’t accurately reflect the trouble and upset this had caused her.
As an agreement couldn’t be reached, the case has been passed to me to review.
 
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss B says that she was approached by P and during a sales meeting at her home told that 
the solar panel system would be entirely self-financing. Neither Miss B nor Creation dispute 
that P misrepresented the benefits of the solar panel system. As a result, this decision will 
deal with what I consider to be fair compensation.
The role of this service is to help settle disputes between consumers and businesses 
providing financial services fairly and reasonable with minimum formality. In cases like this 
one, determining fair compensation isn’t an exact science. My role is to arrive at a fair and 
reasonable outcome taking account of the particular circumstances.
I’ve considered whether it would be appropriate to put Miss B back into the position she 
would have been in if they’re had been no misrepresentation i.e. Creation to refund all 
monies paid by Miss B, arrange for the solar panels to be removed and make good any 
damage caused. My view of Miss B’s complaint is that it isn’t so much about the solar panels 
themselves, but that she was led to believe that they would be self-funding and come at no 
additional cost to her. So, I don’t think it would be fair or proportionate to require the removal 
of the solar panels from her home. Rather, I think the fair outcome here is to put Miss B in a 
position where the panels are self-funding over the original term of the loan. By allowing 
Miss B to keep the solar panels, I’m satisfied that she will likely benefit from lower electricity 
bills and FIT payments going forward (i.e. after the term of the loan has finished).
Miss B has said that she doesn’t believe the assumptions that have been used by Creation 
are fair and result in it over-estimating the benefits she can expect to receive from her solar 
panels. She has provided her own calculation as to what she believes a fair figure would be.
I’ve carefully considered the methodology Creation has submitted to this service to calculate 
the total benefits of Miss B’s solar panel system. This methodology is based on the actual 
performance and estimated future performance of Miss B’s solar panels.
Creation has outlined that when calculating the estimated future performance of Miss B’s 
solar panels, it will make a number of assumptions. These include using a self-consumption 
rate of 37%. This is the percentage of energy generated by her panels that Miss B is 
expected to use rather than buying electricity from her energy provider. 
The self-consumption rate that is used by Miss B’s energy provider to calculate her FIT 
payments is 50%. This is based on the rate that was previously set by the Government. The 
Energy Savings Trust website had previously set out a table that showed the potential 
savings under various scenarios depending on the consumer’s lifestyle rather than a specific 
percentage.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9424698
--------------------------

3
What is clear is that self-consumption is impacted by the period of time that someone is in 
their home and able to use, or self-consume, the electricity that their solar panels are 
generating. It is self-evident that determining an exact figure over the period of the loan is 
difficult. My role is to determine fair compensation and arrive at an outcome that is fair and 
reasonable overall. And in cases of this nature that isn’t an exact science.
Taking the above into account I’m satisfied that using a self-consumption rate of 37% is fair 
and reasonable in this case. I’m of the opinion that this takes into account the evidence I’ve 
discussed above and will also take into account changing consumer occupancy habits over 
the lifetime of the solar panel system. Once the loan has been repaid, I’m satisfied that it is 
highly likely that Miss B will benefit from the solar panel system as a result of a reduction in 
her electricity bills because of the electricity generated by the panels and the FIT payments.
I’ve also considered the other assumptions used by Creation, including electricity price 
inflation, the degradation rate and the retail price index (‘RPI’). I’m of the view that these 
appear reasonable taking into account the actual known figures. As an example, the actual 
average RPI for the last four years doesn’t seem to be far from the assumed figure. In 
summary, I’m satisfied that the assumptions that have been used by Creation provide a fair 
and reasonable basis for calculating fair compensation.
Miss B has said that there is no guarantee that the inverter in her solar panel system won’t 
need replacing and this is likely to cost a significant amount of money. So, I’ve considered 
whether an award should be made for any ongoing maintenance and repair costs.
I’ve looked at the current information available from the Energy Savings Trust. It says that 
solar panels don’t need a lot of maintenance but usually the inverter will need replacing 
‘sometime’ during the lifetime of the solar panel system as a cost of about £800.
I accept that a consumer could have some maintenance and repair costs over the lifetime of 
the solar panels. The proposed approach to put things right for a consumer is to make the 
panels self-funding over the original term of the loan. Once the loan has been repaid, as I’ve 
already outlined above, Miss B is highly likely to enjoy significant benefit from the solar 
panels by way of savings and FIT income going forward. In addition, Miss B has the flexibility 
to be paid a lump sum to cover her overpayments together with interest.
Based on the available information I’m satisfied that the potential benefit will more than cover 
any future maintenance costs and Miss B has the flexibility to be paid her compensation as a 
lump sum payment to pay for a replacement inverter if necessary.
Because of the reasons I’ve given above I’m not persuaded that Creation should make an 
award for maintenance and repair costs.
Creation has also agreed that as long as Miss B can provide it with a copy of her warranty, 
and it can be evidenced that it formed part of the initial contract, it will honour the warranty. 
This doesn’t guarantee the outcome of any future claim but, if Miss B experiences any 
system issues within the original warranty period, she’d be entitled to raise a claim under the 
warranty and Creation will consider it under the warranty terms.
By making the solar panels self-funding, Miss B’s monthly payments will reduce, meaning 
that she would have previously been paying more each month than she should have 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9424698
--------------------------

4
resulting in an overpayment. And as she has been deprived of the monthly overpayment, I 
would expect Creation to add 8% simple interest from the date the overpayment was made 
until the date of the settlement. In a case like this, I think the fairest resolution would be to 
allow Miss B to select from the below four options as to how she would like her 
overpayments and associated interest to be used:
1.
the overpayments and associated interest are used to reduce the outstanding 
balance of her loan and she continues to make her current monthly loan repayment 
resulting in her loan finishing early,
2.
the overpayments and associated interest are used to reduce the outstanding 
balance of the loan and she pays a new, lower monthly payment until the end of the 
loan term,
3.
the overpayments and associated interest are returned to Miss B and she continues 
to pay her current monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early, or;
4.
the overpayments and associated interest are returned to Miss B and she pays a 
new, lower monthly payment until the end of the loan term.
If Miss B accepts my decision, she should indicate on the acceptance form which option she 
would prefer.
Our investigator recommended that Creation pay Miss B £100 to recognise the trouble and 
upset caused. Miss B has said this doesn’t reflect the time and effort she has had to make 
and believes an award of £500 to be more appropriate.
An award for trouble and upset isn’t intended to fine or punish the business – that’s the job of 
the regulator. Whilst I do not doubt that this whole episode has undoubtedly caused her 
trouble and upset, the amount recommended by the investigator is broadly in line with what 
we’d say is fair in the circumstances. Taking everything into account I’ll make an award of 
£100 to cover this.

My final decision
My final decision is that Miss B’s complaint should be upheld. In full and final settlement of it, 
Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:
(a) allow Miss B to keep the solar panels,
(b) estimate the potential savings and income to Miss B from the panels over the 10 year 
loan term and rework it so she pays no more than this. Where possible, it should use 
Miss B’s electricity bills and FIT statements to do this,
(c) add 8% simple interest* to any overpayment made from the date the overpayment 
was made to the date of the settlement,
(d) allow Miss B to decide how she would like her overpayments to be used, using the 
four options described above, and;
(e) pay Miss B £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 March 2020.

*If Creation Consumer Finance Ltd considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Miss B how much it’s taken off. It 
should also give Miss B a certificate showing this, if she asks for one, so she can claim the 
tax from HM Revenue & Customs.

complaint
Mr S is unhappy with Creation Consumer Finance Ltd’s response to his complaint about the 
quality of a bed he bought using finance it provided to him. He’s assisted in bringing his 
complaint by his mother, Ms B.
background
Mr S bought a bed with an integrated TV from A, a retailer, using finance from Creation. The 
bed was delivered on the same day that Mr S was due to go on holiday. A final installation 
check sheet was completed by the delivery team with every section ticked, and this was 
signed by someone at the delivery address as confirmation of delivery and installation.
Two days later, A was told there was a gap between the mattress and the bedframe. When 
Mr S arrived back from holiday, he noticed damage to the TV; which he also reported to A. 
A few months later, an engineer inspected the bed and agreed that the mattress needed 
replacing because it was too short. But A didn’t accept responsibility for the TV damage.
Several months later, Mr S complained to Creation, under the provisions of section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. That section says that, in certain circumstances, a finance 
provider can be responsible for a breach of contract by the supplier. Because there was no 
evidence to prove that the damage was there at the point of delivery, Creation said it 
wouldn’t help. Mr S and his family were unhappy with Creation’s response, and referred the 
matter to us.
In the meantime, Creation arranged for inspection of the bed. The engineer found that the 
trim at the bottom and side of the TV was coming away. He couldn’t find a cause. A second 
engineer visited. He found that the TV had an unsuitable power cable attached causing it to 
catch when being lifted and lowered. A confirmed that a 90 degree angle cable adaptor 
comes as standard with the TV bed. But this wasn’t in place when the engineer visited.
Mr S and his family made the following points:

when they first inspected the bed they found the TV “smashed, completely smashed”. 
They later described the TV as being “cracked”, and said that the lifting mechanism 
was now broken.

there is a gap between the mattress and the bedframe. The bedframe is shaky and 
music played through the built-in speakers cuts out.

the bed is not worth the price they paid for it (£3,970); they found it upsetting when 
the bed was reduced in price to £1,500.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision setting out my thoughts. I said:
“I’m sorry to hear that Mr S hasn’t had the use and enjoyment he expected from the 
bed. But I’m not satisfied that the evidence shows there was any fault with the 
manufacturing, delivery or installation of the bed, other than the mattress gap that the 
supplier has agreed to deal with.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9426229
--------------------------

2
At the time of installation, a check sheet was completed which confirmed that the TV 
was installed correctly and that the power cables were appropriately positioned. The 
damage to the TV wasn’t reported until 17 days after installation. Although I 
understand that Mr S was on holiday during this time, I believe that it’s more than 
likely that the bed was looked at by his family members in order for them to identify 
and report the mattress gap. It’s not unreasonable to expect that if the TV was 
damaged at this time, Mr S’s family would’ve noticed it.
I’m also mindful that the descriptions of the damage to the TV have varied 
considerably over time. These differences in description make it very difficult to 
determine when or how any damage was caused. The TV has been described as 
being “completely smashed”, as having a crack in the screen giving rise to colour 
disturbance when turned on, as having a crack in the trim at the lower edge, and as 
having lost the “bottom edge of the outer plastic frame”. In May 2017, Mr S told the 
investigator that the damage was limited to the screen, and that it wasn’t really visible 
when the TV was off. Yet, the photographs and reports I have seen suggest that the 
damage is a crack in the trim.
Whatever the nature of the damage, I’ve seen no convincing evidence of how or 
when it occurred. But I think that the supplier’s check sheet is a good indication that it 
wasn’t present at installation. I note also that Ms B told the investigator that Mr S had 
used the bed “when everything was working”. And this does point to the bed being in 
working order at the beginning.
The investigator upheld Mr S’s complaint because she thought it likely that the 
damage to the TV flowed from the wrong power cable being used at installation. I 
don’t agree that the evidence shows this. Had the wrong power cable been used at 
installation, I’d have expected Mr S to make some mention of the lift mechanism 
juddering or the TV catching on the housing at the foot-end of the bed. But this didn’t 
feature as any part of his evidence to us. And I’ve seen no evidence that this issue 
was reported to the supplier either.
It wasn’t until April 2017 that Ms B first mentioned to us that the lift mechanism might 
be broken, and then only when specifically asked by the investigator. I also note that 
the independent engineer who inspected the TV in June 2017 made no mention of 
the lift mechanism juddering or there being a problem with the power cable. And I 
would’ve expected the engineer to do so, given he identified the damage as affecting 
the “trim at the bottom and side” of the TV. He also inspected the TV whilst it was 
within the bed and elevated on the lift mechanism. The horizontal position of the 
power cable is obvious in the pictures taken by the July engineer, and yet it was not 
referred to at all by the engineer in June. There’s also some discrepancy about the 
functioning of the lift mechanism itself. Ms B has said that it doesn’t work at all; that 
the TV “doesn’t come up or down”. But the engineer who inspected it in July found it 
capable of lifting and lowering the TV; it juddered but it did lift the TV.
In my opinion, the fact that the 90 degree adaptor wasn’t in place at the engineer’s 
inspection in July 2017, doesn’t mean that it wasn’t in place at the time of installation. 
It’s relevant that the supplier says the adaptor comes as standard and the check 
sheet shows that the cables where appropriately positioned at installation. There 
were no complaints of juddering earlier. And between installation and the July 2017 
inspection, Mr S and Ms B had dismantled and reassembled the bed. The TV had 
also been completely removed by them from its housing at least once. So I think it’s 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9426229
--------------------------

3
more likely than not that the adaptor was lost or removed at some point after 
installation.
I appreciate that Mr S is very unhappy with the TV bed and regrets this purchase; 
but, on what I’ve seen so far, I don’t think Creation has done anything wrong in 
refusing to replace the bed or to allow Mr S to reject and return the bed.”
responses to my provisional decision
Creation accepted my provisional decision. But Mr S and Ms B didn’t. They maintained the 
TV had never been used and still had protective film on it. Ms B referred to the original 
inspection, instructed by A, which she felt supported her position. And she asked that I listen 
to the calls they made to A when they first reported the damage.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, although I know that my 
decision will disappoint Mr S, I do not uphold his complaint.
Noting Ms B’s comments in response to my provisional decision, I have seen the report 
produced from the first inspection. I’ve also listened to the call recordings A still holds. 
Having done so, I don’t find these give me reason to reach a different conclusion. I would, 
though, make the following observations.
At the first inspection, in addition to his finding about the mattress, the engineer also 
checked the TV. He found that whilst the sound worked, “the screen [was] cracked internally 
and remain[ed] blank”. The engineer offered no explanation as to the cause of the damage 
to the TV. And the only image of the TV attached to the report doesn’t make clear the 
location of the damage. Although this evidence helps to establish the nature of the damage, 
and confirms that it was present a few months after delivery, it doesn’t help to identify how or 
when it occurred, which is the key issue in Mr S’s dispute with Creation.
The only information the call recordings add is that Mr S’s partner says, “when we received 
the bed, that same day, we didn’t really have time to inspect the bed … we went on our 
holiday …”  This strongly suggests that Mr S and/or his partner were there at the point of 
delivery. So they had the opportunity to check the condition of the bed and TV, even if they 
were preparing to go on holiday. They said they didn’t do this because they assumed the TV 
would be fine. That may well be the case, but taking into account the fully completed 
checklist, I’m not persuaded that the problems with the TV were present when the bed was 
delivered.
Because of this, I can see why Creation has taken the stance it has. So while I realise that 
leaves Mr S in the unfortunate position of having a damaged TV, I don’t require Creation to 
take steps to rectify that situation.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr S’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 June 2018.

complaint
Mr L complains that the car he acquired through a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd (the business) was not of satisfactory quality. He has had repairs 
carried out and wants the cost of these refunded.
background
Mr L entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with business to acquire a car in March 2016. 
At this time the car was eight years old and had been driven 57,500 miles.
Mr L says that the brakes were an issue on the test drive but he thought this could be due to 
the car having been stood at the dealers. However the issue did not go. In May 2016, the 
brakes needed to be repaired and Mr L paid for this. The dealer gave him £50 as a gesture 
of goodwill towards the cost but Mr L says that he shouldn’t have had to pay anything for this 
repair because the issue was present at the point of sale. When the brakes were being 
repaired it was discovered that the locking wheel nut was damaged and needed to be 
replaced along with the keys. Mr L says this cost should also be covered by the dealer.
In June, Mr L reported an issue with the air conditioning. He was told to take it to the dealer 
but they didn’t deal with air conditioning so he was told to take it to another garage. The 
issue was resolved at no cost to Mr L but he says that he was without the car for six days.
After the air conditioning issue had been resolved, Mr L says the bonnet would not open. He 
contacted the business about his complaint at this stage. He says he was told to have the 
repair to the bonnet carried out and then submit the invoice. He did this and wants this 
amount reimbursed. Because of the issues Mr L experienced he says he arranged and paid 
for a safety check.
The business says that it contacted the broker which said that because repairs were carried 
out without its authorisation it would not take any further action. It says that because of this it 
did not uphold this complaint.
The dealer says that when Mr L acquired the car it had a new MOT and that there were no 
advisories. It says that although the issue with the brakes was a wear and tear item it gave 
Mr L £50 as a gesture of goodwill towards the repair cost. In June when the issue with the air 
conditioning was reported it says this again was a wear and tear but it arranged for the car to 
go to a specialist for the issue to be resolved at no cost to Mr L. 
The dealer notes that the issue with the bonnet occurred while the car was having the air 
conditioning dealt with. It says that this Mr L should address this issue to the garage that 
caused it.
The adjudicator upheld this complaint. She said that it wasn’t fair to expect Mr L to know that 
he needed to speak to the business before having repairs carried out. She said that it wasn’t 
fair to expect the business to refund Mr L the cost of the MOT but she did find that it should 
refund the cost of the repairs.
The business did not accept that it should pay for the repairs. It said that Mr L did not raise 
the issues with it or the supplier or broker before having the repairs carried out.

my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr L’s complaint relates to the costs he has had to pay to repair his car in the first few 
months after acquisition. 
Mr L acquired a used car in mid March 2016. At this time the car was eight years old and 
had been driven 57,500 miles. Because Mr L financed the acquisition with a loan agreement 
from the business, the business is liable if the car was not of satisfactory quality at the point 
of sale. When assessing satisfactory quality the age and mileage of the car are taken into 
account.
The first issue related to the brakes. Mr L says that this issue was noticeable on the test 
drive but he and the dealer believed it would resolve itself once the car had been driven for a 
while (it had been standing at the dealers). However when the issue did not go away Mr L 
took the car for repair. 
I have looked at the car’s MOT history and can see the MOT was carried out in November 
2015. I note that no issues were raised and that the car was not driven more than a few 
miles between that date and when Mr L acquired it. I accept that issues with the brakes are 
generally considered wear and tear; however I note Mr L’s comments about the issue being 
present on the test drive. Therefore, I find it reasonable in this case to accept that it was 
more likely than not that the issue was present at the point of sale. I also find that the issue 
with the locking wheel nut would have been noted had the repair been carried out before Mr 
L took delivery of the car. Because of this I find it reasonable that Mr L is refunded the cost 
of this repair less the £50 that the dealer paid.
Mr L then experienced an issue with the air conditioning. Mr L says that the dealer first sent 
him to the wrong garage and then he went to a specialist garage and the air conditioning 
was topped up. I accept that the need to top up air conditioning units would not be 
considered a fault. However Mr L says that this did not resolve the issue and the car had to 
be returned. Mr L has mentioned a leak in the condenser and it is clear given the need to 
return the car more than once that the issue was not just the air conditioning needing topping 
up. This all happened within the first six months. I do not have further information on this 
issue but there is nothing to show that the problems were not caused by a fault that was 
present at the point of sale. 
This issue was resolved at no cost to Mr L which is reasonable. However while this repair 
took place the bonnet latch was damaged. Mr L says that he contacted the business about 
this and was told to go ahead with the repair and submit his invoice. I have listened to the 
call and Mr L was told to go ahead with the repair. However the business did explain that 
only once the complaint had been fully investigated would they be able to decide whether 
they would refund the cost or not. 
Because the damage was caused while Mr L’s car was being repaired for another issue that 
was identified within the first six months, and the repair was arranged by the dealer, I find the 
fair resolution is for the cost of this repair to be refunded.

I understand why Mr L decided to have a health check carried out on the car. However this 
was his choice and I do not find it reasonable that the business is required to cover the cost 
of this.
The business says that Mr L did not contact the correct people before repairs were 
undertaken. However based on the information I have seen I find that Mr L did make 
reasonable attempts to contact the relevant parties as he saw fit in regard to issues he 
experienced. Because of this I find it reasonable that the repairs he paid for are refunded.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should 
refund Mr L for the repairs he paid for less the £50 already paid. This comes to a total of 
£318.36.
For the avoidance of doubt I do not require the cost of the MOT or vehicle health check to be 
refunded.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2017.

complaint
Mr S complains Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold him a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
In 2006, Mr S took out a £10,000 loan by phone to buy a car. He also bought a PPI policy. 
The cost of the policy was added to the loan and paid back over the loan term.
Both adjudicators who looked at Mr S’s complaint thought it should be upheld. The last 
adjudicator said she didn’t think Creation had made it clear to Mr S either that he had a 
choice about buying the PPI or how much the cover would cost him. The adjudicator didn’t 
think Mr S would’ve bought the PPI if he’d known these things.
Creation disagreed. It said its call script and the paperwork Mr S was sent afterwards made 
these things clear. So Mr S’s complaint has come to me.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We’ve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
I’ve taken this into account in deciding Mr S’s case.
I’ve decided to uphold this complaint for two reasons. I don’t think Creation made it clear to 
Mr S either that he had a choice about buying the PPI or how much the cover would cost 
him.
My reasons for deciding Creation didn’t make it clear to Mr S that he had a choice about 
buying PPI are:

The sales script Creation says it would’ve used when it sold Mr S’s PPI doesn’t say 
anything about telling Mr S he had a choice about the cover. And it doesn’t say 
anything about getting Mr S’s explicit consent. It does refer to two quotes, with and 
without PPI. But it’s not clear how these would’ve been described to Mr S and, in 
particular, how the “without” quote would’ve been presented.

The script does talk about cancellation rights. But I don’t think this brief mention 
would’ve given Mr S the confidence to cancel the policy, when Creation hadn’t made 
it clear in the first place he had a choice about buying it. 

The loan agreement Creation sent Mr S afterwards also doesn’t make it clear he had 
a choice. I can see he’s ticked and signed for PPI on the agreement. But the 
agreement doesn’t say what will happen if Mr S doesn’t tick and sign. I can also see, 
at the end of the statement of price (which itself is at the end of the policy summary), 
there’s a sentence saying PPI isn’t a requirement of the loan. But I think it would’ve 
been very easy for Mr S to miss this.
My reasons for deciding Creation didn’t make the cost of the cover clear to Mr S are:
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9460116
--------------------------

2

The sales script doesn’t clearly set out the policy costs. The loan agreement did set 
out the premium (£1,854.34) and the total cost of the PPI (£2,231.30). But it didn’t set 
out the interest (£376.70) as a separate figure. I don’t think it was reasonable to 
expect Mr S to work that out for himself. He was entitled to expect all the important 
information about the cost of the policy, including how much interest he’d pay, to be 
in the loan agreement.  
•
The statement of price I’ve already mentioned did set out the interest. But, as I’ve 
also mentioned, it was at the end of the policy summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or 
where Mr S might expect it to be.   
•
None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy either. This would’ve 
been good practice and it might have helped Mr S to have a better understanding of 
what the PPI was costing him.  
I don’t think Mr S would’ve bought PPI if Creation had told him clearly that he had a choice, 
or if he’d known how much it was going to cost him, compared to the amount of his loan and 
what he was paying for it.
what Creation must do to put things right
Mr S borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he 
paid more than he should’ve each month. Mr S needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So, Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:

Work out and pay Mr S the difference between what he paid each month on the loan and 
what he would’ve paid each month without PPI.

Add simple interest to the extra amount Mr S paid each month from when he paid it until 
he gets it back. The rate of interest is 8% a year†.
If Mr S made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax it’s taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve given, I uphold Mr S’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must 
pay Mr S compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2015.

complaint
Mr S is unhappy that Creation Consumer Finance Limited recorded adverse information 
against his credit file. 
background
Mr S had a loan with Creation. As part of the loan agreement, he had to make regular 
monthly repayments. Mr S said he did this for the most part, but towards the end of the 
agreement, he changed his bank and so provided Creation with his new bank details so the 
repayments would continue. But this did not happen and so the repayments were not made. 
Mr S said this was Creation’s fault as he was not to know the repayments had stopped. He 
also said he did not receive any communication from Creation telling him about the problem 
it was experiencing with his repayments. Mr S wants Creation to amend the adverse 
information it recorded against his credit file. 
Creation has declined to make any adjustments to Mr S’ credit file. It said the information it 
recorded is a true reflection of what happened and that it no longer administers the loan as it 
was passed to a third party debt recovery firm. It also said it sent Mr S numerous letters and 
texts as well as attempted to speak to him by phone – all of which went unanswered. 
Our investigator thought Creation had done what it needed to. He accepted Mr S updated 
his bank details and that there was a problem with Creation taking the money. But he 
highlighted it attempted to contact him to try and sort the issue. He also said that it was Mr S’ 
responsibility to ensure his repayments were made. 
Mr S disagreed. In summary he said he made the majority of payments and says this as an 
indicator that he would not have intentionally missed the last year of repayments. He 
maintains that he received no letters and disputes the amount of the last payment he made. 
And so it’s for me to make a decision. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I’m not persuaded by the arguments made by Mr S and I’d like to explain why. Mr S signed 
an agreement with Creation for the loan. As part of this agreement, it says;
'The total amount is payable by 48 monthly instalments of £422.93 the first payable on
20/02/2014 and remainder payable on the same date of each succeeding month'. 
It goes on to say;
'Charges and interest will be payable if you do not make the repayments that are due
under the agreement on time. This may mean that it will cost more to pay off the loan.
Your credit rating may be adversely affected and could make obtaining credit more
difficult and expensive in the future. It may also result in legal action being taken to
recover that debt'.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9470457
--------------------------

2
The reason I’ve highlighted this part of the agreement is because this puts the responsibility 
on Mr S to ensure his repayments are made and on time. I acknowledge what Mr S 
explained about not realising his monthly repayments were not being made, but I’m not 
persuaded by it. I find it unlikely that someone would not notice a large amount of money like 
this not being collected from their account. In addition, it’s Mr S’ responsibility to make sure 
he his monthly repayments were met. And given he noticed his repayment in April 2017 was 
not made, I think it reasonable to expect he would have noticed, in the same way, when his 
other repayments had stopped.
Creation has also provided evidence to show that it sent Mr S a large number of letters, text 
messages and phone calls to try and establish what was happening, in addition to letting him 
know it had defaulted his credit file and then instructed debt collectors to recover the 
outstanding balance. So even if I take on face value that Mr S did not receive any contact 
from Creation about this, I’m still satisfied it took reasonable steps to try and engage and 
notify Mr S about the situation – which is what I’d expect it to do in circumstances such as 
these. And so although Mr S explained Creation should have emailed him, I do not agree for 
the reasons I’ve explained. I’d also like to highlight Mr S received letters from Creation in the 
past, so I find it unlikely he did not receive any of the 20+ sent from May 2017.
Mr S has also disputed the amount of the last payment he made in April 2017. Our 
investigator suggested it was lower than the contractual monthly payment. Having carefully 
considered this point, I’m satisfied Mr S made the repayment in full and not a reduced 
amount. I note Creation’s own evidence supports this and so Mr S does not need to provide 
any further proof in this regard.   
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I don’t uphold Mr S’ complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 September 2018.

complaint
Mrs J complains that she was mis-sold solar panels. The cost was funded by a fixed sum 
loan from Creation Consumer Finance Ltd.
background
Mrs J entered into a fixed sum loan with Creation in May 2013 to pay for the cost of solar 
panels in her home. She had to make 120 monthly payments of £130.16. Mrs J says that 
she was told the solar panels would not cost her money. She thought they would save her 
money. Mrs J is unhappy that the savings in her energy bills is less than the monthly loan 
payments. Mrs J raised this with the supplier. It paid her £600. This was because she had 
been wrongly charged for the panels fitted, and it included a sum to help with the loan 
repayments. 
The company that supplied the panels to Mrs J has since gone into liquidation. 
Mrs J complained to Creation but it did not uphold her complaint. It said the repayments Mrs 
J would have to make were clear from the documents she signed. She brought her 
complaint to us to consider. 
The adjudicator did not recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She noted that Mrs 
J had not paid for electricity bills since the panels were installed. The adjudicator considered 
that the loan repayments she would have to make were clear from the loan agreement she 
signed. Mrs J was given a document showing her estimated savings. It was clear from this 
that it would not cover the loan repayments. 
Mrs J is not happy to accept the adjudicator’s recommendation. She says, in summary, that 
her monthly energy bill was £66 before the panels were fitted. Mrs J now has to pay £116 to 
cover her bill and loan repayment. She was told the panels would not cost her anything. 
Mrs J complained on a number of occasions to the supplier but did not receive a response. 
She has to pay £4,534.20 in interest payments under the loan.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mrs J feels very strongly about this issue and I have considered her 
submissions carefully. She says the panels were misrepresented to her. Mrs J was told that 
they wouldn’t cost her anything. This isn’t the case, in part due to the interest payable under 
the loan agreement.  
As I was not present at the meeting between Mrs J and the salesperson, I cannot know 
exactly what was said. I must also consider the documentation and what this tells me. On 
the face of it, the agreement Mrs J signed makes it clear that it is a loan agreement. There is 
a section setting out the cost of the solar panels, and the separate interest Mrs J will be 
charged. I can see that the section setting out the interest rate is directly above the signature 
box where Mrs J signed. I would expect Mrs J to have carefully checked the agreement 
before she signed it. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9554090
--------------------------

2
Mrs J was also left with a copy of the agreement showing the interest on the loan and setting 
out her right to withdraw from the agreement within 14 days. Mrs J would have had the 
opportunity to review this at her leisure once the salesperson had left.
Mrs J is adamant that the finance agreement was mis-sold as she was told the panels would 
effectively be free. I have no reason to doubt her understanding of the transaction. But 
having considered all of the evidence, particularly the paperwork, I do not have strong 
enough evidence to conclude that the finance agreement was mis-sold.  
I know my decision will come as a disappointment to her, but I hope Mrs J will understand 
why I have decided not to uphold the complaint. 
 
my final decision
For the reasons I have explained, my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2016.

complaint
Mr R bought a sofa using a fixed sum loan from Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (CCF). He 
complains that the sofa was not of satisfactory quality.
background 
Mr R agreed the purchase and the loan in December 2007. The loan agreement included an 
option to settle free of interest, provided that payment was made by December 2008.
The sofa was delivered to Mr R in March 2008. He complained about defects to the supplier 
in October 2008. He said he was told that he would receive a replacement, but the supplier 
entered administration shortly thereafter. 
Mr R complained to CCF in April 2009:

Seeking to reject the sofa and to obtain a refund of his £99 purchase deposit

Also seeking compensation 

Saying that he would be withholding payments to his loan account.
CCF wrote to Mr R in October 2009, saying that he would need to demonstrate the defect 
was present at the time of delivery, and that he should obtain (at his own expense) an 
independent inspection report. CCF also asked him to settle the outstanding balance on his 
account, and warned him that failure to maintain payments would adversely affect his credit 
file. 
In February 2012, Mr R referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. In 
February 2013, CCF issued its final response letter to him. In September 2013, he obtained 
an independent inspection report (costing £150) that said the sofa had a manufacturing fault. 
In November 2013, our adjudicator recommended that to resolve this complaint CCF should:

Allow Mr R to pay it £705.03 in order to settle the loan account – this being the 
amount that would have applied in February 2009 (before the account went into 
arrears, and related interest and other charges were applied to it) – provided that 
payment is made within 30 days of acceptance of this offer;

Arrange to have the sofa repaired; 

Refund the independent inspection cost to Mr R.
CCF had already agreed in October 2013 to remove the adverse entries (including a default 
marker) it had applied to Mr R’s credit file. It accepted our adjudicator’s recommendation, but 
Mr R did not. He responded to say this was not the outcome he was seeking, and he did not 
feel that he should have to pay the outstanding balance.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I find that I have come to the same 
conclusion as our adjudicator, for the same reasons.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9556142
--------------------------

2
Because Mr R made this purchase using a loan agreed with CCF, and the sofa was found to 
be defective at the point of delivery, he can bring a claim against it under Section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. CCF has agreed to fulfil its obligations under this legislation by 
repairing the sofa. But Mr R has a parallel obligation to make the payments required under 
the loan agreement.
I feel that both parties have allowed this dispute to drift over several years, by not acting in 
ways that would have helped draw matters to a conclusion. I agree with our adjudicator that 
Mr R should not be released from his obligation to repay his debt. But I also agree that it 
would be unfair to make him pay the additional interest and other charges, applied to his 
account during the course of this dispute.
Therefore, I consider our adjudicator’s recommendations to be both well balanced, and fair 
and reasonable.  
my final decision
For the reasons explained above, my decision is that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
should:
1.
Allow Mr R to pay it £705.03 in order to settle the loan account – provided that 
payment is made within 30 days of acceptance of my decision.
2.
Remove all the adverse entries it made on Mr R’s credit file relating to this loan – 
again provided that the account is settled as above within 30 days of acceptance of 
my decision.
3.
Arrange to have the sofa repaired. 
4.
Refund £150 to Mr R.

complaint
Mrs D has complained Creation Consumer Finance Limited hasn’t refunded the money she’s 
paid for solar panels. She doesn’t think the solar panels are performing as she was told they 
would.
background 
In April 2014 Mrs D took out a loan with Creation for £10,450. This paid for solar panels to 
be fitted to her property. She believed any cost she was paying for the loan would be offset 
by the income she received for generating electricity and lower electricity bills.
She complained to the supplier, M, quite soon after the panels were fitted. She was 
concerned she was paying her monthly payments for the loan – over £136 a month – and 
she wasn’t able to afford it. M offered her £2,000 which she didn’t think was enough. She 
brought her complaint to the ombudsman service.
Our adjudicator felt the solar panels weren’t performing as promised to Mrs D. She said the 
agreement should be cancelled allowing Mrs D to keep the panels. M asked us to review at 
least a year’s worth of income and electricity bills as they felt Mrs D was getting the 
predicted output.
Creation has asked for this complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I looked at the two main aspects of this complaint when I completed a provisional decision 
on 3 September 2015. This includes when Mrs D first took out the agreement and signed the 
contract as well as the performance of the solar panels.
It’s clear Mrs D was in two minds when she first signed up to the solar panels. She initially 
decided not to and then changed her mind. I believe she was influenced by being told they 
would be “cost neutral”. It’s also worth noting she agreed to get solar panels when she was 
off work. She has since stopped working and lost an income. I’m in no doubt she wouldn’t 
have entered into a long-term financial contract if she though it was going to cost her a lot of 
money.
I asked Creation about the affordability checks carried out on Mrs D but they weren’t able to 
provide any evidence about what these included. I wasn’t convinced they’d shown she could 
afford to pay for the solar panels. Since the provisional decision went out, Creation has 
provided us with more information on this aspect. They told us Mrs D and her husband had a 
household income of sufficient amount to cover what she was being asked to repay. Whilst 
Creation has pointed out Mrs D hasn’t missed a payment, I don’t believe her current 
household income is the same as she’s no longer working.
Based on the evidence, I believe Mrs D thought the solar panels weren’t going to cost her 
very much. The monthly payment to Creation would be offset by money from her electric 
company and lower bills. I have looked at her bills and the money she’s got from her electric 
company. Over the last year Mrs D has received payments totalling £562 for the electricity

--------------------------

2
generated by her panels. As M has said, this is more than was originally predicted to be 
generated.  
However I see Mrs D has had no savings on the cost of her bills. The amount of electricity 
used in the period November 2014 to June 2015 is not less than the period the year before 
the panels were fitted.
I’ve seen from Mrs D’s electricity bills she’s very conscious of her energy costs. She 
changes her tariff regularly to cut down what she has to pay. I can’t really see why she’d 
agree to pay for solar panels if they were going to cost her significantly more, as they have. 
So I believe she was told they’d be “cost neutral”.
That said I don’t believe the panels are massively underperforming.  
However I don’t believe Mrs D should have been given an agreement for 10 years when I’m 
satisfied there’s not enough evidence she could afford this. As Mrs D is getting a benefit 
from the panels, I don’t think it would be fair if she paid nothing for these whilst they remain.  
I’ve carefully considered what should be a fair outcome in this case. I’ve not changed my 
mind since my provisional decision but I’ve taken on board Creation’s views. I think Mrs D 
should pay 25% of the costs of the agreement. She was paying £16,470.29 so this means 
she will have to pay £4,117.58. This reflects the affordability issues and what she was told 
when she bought the panels in the first place.  
my final decision
For the reasons I’ve given, my final decision is to instruct Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited to:
•
Recalculate Mrs D’s finance agreement so she only pays 25% of her original 
commitment;
•
Take off that total what’s she’s already paid since April 2014;
•
Provide her with a revised monthly amount she needs to pay for the remainder of the 
agreement; and
•
Update her credit record with the revised financial information.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2015.

complaint
Mrs B complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd cannot locate a £37.50 payment she 
made into her account.
background
Mrs B went into her bank on 21 June 2018 and paid £37.50 cash into her Creation account. 
The bank stamped her statement acknowledging receipt of the money. Mrs B’s unhappy that 
despite providing it with evidence of the payment, Creation hasn’t applied the money to her 
account and has continued to chase her for its payment. It’s also applied interest and 
charges to her account and recorded adverse information on her credit file. She wants the 
money credited onto her account, the interest and charges refunded and her credit file 
amended.
Creation said in its final response that it hadn’t been able to trace the £37.50 payment Mrs B 
made through her bank into her account on 21 June 2018. 
Our investigator felt this complaint should be upheld. She said:

Mrs B has provided a copy of her account monthly statement which was stamped by 
her bank acknowledging receipt of the £37.50 payment on 21 June 2018.

Mrs B has made enquiries with her bank which show the payment was made to the 
same account details as shown on her Creation statement. Creation is still trying to 
trace the payment. But on balance its more likely Mrs B’s bank allocated the money 
correctly, than not.

So, to put things right Creation should apply Mrs B’s £37.50 payment to her account 
and remove any late payment charges and interest that have accrued. It should also 
remove any negative information recorded about this from Mrs B’s credit file. And as 
Mrs B has been caused distress and inconvenience including by being continually 
chased for the debt, sent default letters and has had to call Creation she should also 
be paid £75 compensation.
Mrs B accepted the investigator’s view and said this matter shouldn’t have got this far. There 
was obvious evidence the payment was made. And this could’ve damaged her good credit 
record. 
Creation said it didn’t agree and has asked for an ombudsman review. It said it could 
understand how the investigator came to her view on the balance of probabilities but the 
payment still hasn’t been traced. It asked if Mrs B’s bank could trace it.
The investigator said Mrs B’s bank had confirmed that a trace on a payment of less than £40 
wouldn’t be possible. And that an audit trail has been competed with no evidence of any 
returned or bounced back payment. As far as the bank is concerned the payment has been 
cleared and paid correctly.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9648465
--------------------------

2
Some of the evidence in this case is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory. So, I’ve made 
my decision based on what I think is more likely to have happened than not. 
I agree with the investigator’s conclusions for the same reasons.
I’m satisfied on the available evidence that on 21 June 2018 Mrs B paid £37.50 cash into her 
bank to be credited to her Creation account. This is evidenced by the bank acknowledging 
receipt of this money by adding its official till stamp to Mrs B’s statement from Creation. And 
it appears the money was credited to the correct account details.
Although a payment of this size cannot be traced by Mrs B’s bank it has confirmed, albeit 
verbally and not in writing as Creation would like, that its audit trail doesn’t show any 
evidence of this payment being returned or bounced back. 
Creation still cannot trace the money. But that’s not Mrs B’s fault and I don’t think she should 
be disadvantaged because this payment has gone astray. 
Consequently I think, on balance, that it’s fair for Creation to apply Mrs B’s £37.50 payment 
to her account even though it can’t trace its receipt. I think it’s also reasonable for Creation to 
remove any late payment charges and interest applied to her account since 21 June 2018 
and to restore Mrs B’s otherwise good credit history by removing any negative information 
recorded about this matter from that date, from her Mrs B’s credit file.
Mrs B has co-operated with Creation throughout. This has included her sending it evidence 
of the bank’s receipt a number of times, repeatedly contacting Creation, dealing with its 
ongoing debt collection communications and taking steps to trace the payment with her own 
bank including visiting her branch a couple of times. She’s also been understandably worried 
that her otherwise good credit history has been affected.
Mrs B has clearly been put to some distress and considerable inconvenience as a result. I 
agree with the investigator that this warrants a payment of some compensation. The 
investigator felt £75 was a fair award when she issued her view in December 2018. But as 
this matter still hasn’t been resolved and Mrs B’s distress and inconvenience has continued 
for another couple of months since then I think that now isn’t quite enough. 
Overall I think it’s fair for the award of compensation now to be increased to £100.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint. To put things right Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should, if it hasn’t 
done so already:
1.
Apply Mrs B’s £37.50 payment to her account even though it can’t trace its receipt; 
2.
Remove any late payment charges and interest applied to Mrs B’s account since 21 
June 2018;
3.
Remove from Mrs B’s credit file any negative information recorded about this matter 
from that date; and 
4.
Pay Mrs B £100 compensation.

Creation must pay the compensation within 28 days of the date on which we tell it Mrs B 
accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest on the 
compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 8% a year simple.
If Creation considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Mrs B how much it’s taken off. It should also give her a tax 
deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2019.

complaint
Mr R complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited cancelled his direct debit mandate 
for his payments under a fixed sum loan agreement and that it’s recorded missed payments 
and a default on his credit file.
background
Mr R entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance in July 2015 
to pay for some furniture. It was an interest free loan with no repayments until March 2016 
and then 36 monthly repayments of £59.02 which were to be paid by direct debit. He 
switched banks and noticed in July 2017 that there were two direct debit mandates to 
Creation – one active and one inactive. Mr R gave notice to cancel the inactive mandate but 
the active mandate was cancelled so his repayments weren’t collected. 
Creation Consumer Finance tried to contact Mr R but he’d moved and not given it his new 
address. Six repayments were missed so it defaulted the account and sold the debt to a debt 
collection agency in January 2018. The missed payments and default were recorded on his 
credit file - but when he was contacted by the debt collection agency he cleared the debt. 
He then complained to Creation Consumer Finance. It said that it had received a direct debit 
cancellation from Mr R’s bank which it acted on and it attempted to contact him by letters 
and phone calls. Mr R wasn’t satisfied with its response so complained to this service. He’s 
also made a separate complaint about his bank.
The investigator recommended that this complaint should be upheld. He said that when Mr R 
switched banks in 2015 his bank sent Creation Consumer Finance details of his direct debit 
but Creation sent it back with a different reference (an additional letter) so two direct debits 
were set up. He said that Mr R reasonably cancelled the inactive mandate in July 2017 when 
he became aware of it but that the reference for it didn’t match Creation Consumer Finance’s 
reference and he said that it had a responsibility to check it with the bank. He recommended 
that Creation Consumer Finance should remove the default and the missed payments from 
Mr R’s credit file but he didn’t think that it needed to do anything else as it was Mr R’s 
responsibility to ensure that he advised it of his change of address. 
Mr R has accepted the investigator’s recommendation but Creation Consumer Finance has 
asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says that it uses the bank 
account number and sort code to identify the cancelled mandate as the reference isn’t 
always complete on the reports submitted and it wouldn’t be possible to double check all the 
requests it receives on a daily basis. And it doesn’t agree that checking with Mr R’s bank 
was an option. It says that it tried to contact Mr R but he hadn’t updated his personal details, 
as required by the terms agreed in the credit agreement.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr R became aware in July 2017 that there were two direct debit mandates to Creation 
Consumer Finance on his account – one active and one inactive. He gave notice to cancel 
the inactive mandate but the active mandate was cancelled. I’ve seen no evidence to show 
that Mr R intended to give – or gave – notice to cancel the active mandate. As a result of the 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9667291

2
cancellation of the active mandate Mr R’s monthly repayment to Creation Consumer Finance 
wasn’t collected.
It then made reasonable efforts to contact Mr R by letters and by phone calls. But he’d 
moved and not given it his new address (as he was required to do by the terms of the 
agreement) and the phone number that it had for him wasn’t correct. Six payments were 
missed and his account was defaulted and the debt sold to a debt collection agency. But in 
the circumstances that Mr R has described I can understand how he overlooked the need to 
tell Creation Consumer Finance about his new address. But if he’d done so he’d only have 
missed one payment and it wouldn’t have defaulted his account or recorded adverse 
information on his credit file.
When Mr R was contacted by the debt collection agency in January 2018 he cleared the 
debt. I don’t consider that Mr R cancelled the active mandate and I’m not persuaded that his 
failure to tell Creation Consumer Finance about his change of address justifies the adverse 
information that it’s recorded on his credit file – and the consequences that have arisen from 
that.
So I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Creation Consumer 
Finance to remove the adverse information about the agreement that it’s recorded on Mr R’s 
credit file. But I’m not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr R’s complaint. And I order Creation 
Consumer Finance Limited to remove the adverse information about the fixed sum loan 
agreement that it’s recorded on Mr R’s credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2020.

K820x#14
complaint
Mr K has complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold him a fixed sum loan 
agreement.
background
In January 2016, Mr K bought some furniture on a ‘buy now pay later’ arrangement. The 
terms of the arrangement required Mr K to either:

Make 36 monthly payments of £121.68 starting on 4 November 2016; or

Pay £2,508 on or before 7 October 2016 (the “special offer date”) and avoid all 
interest charges
Mr K paid nothing towards the loan by October 2106, and so interest was added. Mr K was 
unhappy about this and he complained to Creation. He explained he wasn’t happy that 
interest had been applied, that he’d been mis-advised as to the arrangement in store and 
that he hadn’t received the reminder letter (to pay the outstanding balance). 
Creation didn’t uphold Mr K’s complaint. It said that he had agreed to this particular 
arrangement, and that he’d been sent a reminder regarding the amount due in September 
2016. 
Mr K wasn’t happy with Creation’s response and so he referred his complaint to us. 
He explained he’d been ‘lured’ by the interest free element of the loan at the time he’d 
bought the furniture and said he could’ve paid for it up front. He said he’d been led to believe 
the loan was interest free, that he’d make monthly instalments via direct debit, and that the 
full amount would be paid off within a year.
He also said he hadn’t signed the credit agreement and that he’d never received the 
reminder letter in September 2016. Mr K explained he’d moved house since originally taking 
out the loan, and he thinks Creation should’ve tried to contact him by email or phone as well 
as by letter.
An investigator looked into Mr K’s complaint and didn’t think it should be upheld. She didn’t 
think there was enough evidence to show that Creation had done anything wrong. 
Mr K didn’t agree with the investigator’s opinion. He added that he had another direct debit 
of a similar amount going out of his account each month, which is why he didn’t notice he 
hadn’t been paying for the furniture. 
Because Mr K didn’t agree with the investigator’s opinion, his complaint has been passed to 
me for a decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I’ve decided not to 
uphold the complaint, for broadly the same reasons as the investigator.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9684275
--------------------------

2
I’ve first looked at Mr K’s complaint point regarding being misled at the point he took out the 
loan. I appreciate that Mr K says he had enough money to pay for his furniture outright, and 
while I accept this may have been the case, it doesn’t automatically follow that the loan was 
unsuitable. I’ve also not seen persuasive evidence that Mr K was put under pressure not to 
buy the furniture outright. 
Mr K also says he didn’t sign the agreement, but I can see it was signed electronically on     
7 January 2016. I’ve also seen a letter addressed to Mr K, also dated 7 January, which 
explained the buy now pay later arrangement in more detail. Creation says it would’ve given 
Mr K a copy of both the agreement and the letter at the time of the sale. But Mr K says 
Creation has told him this would’ve been emailed to him.
I can’t know for sure whether Creation gave Mr K this paperwork at the time of the sale, 
emailed it to him afterwards, or what was discussed. But I think it’s reasonable to conclude 
Mr K knew he’d taken out some kind of credit in order to pay for the furniture, given he hadn’t 
paid for it in full. And while Mr K says that he wasn’t expecting to pay for the furniture until 
April 2016 - when it was delivered - no payment was made in April either. So I’d have 
expected him to have made enquiries as to how he’d pay for the furniture around this time. 
I note Mr K has said he thought he was paying for the furniture monthly by direct debits, and 
that he hadn’t noticed he wasn’t because he had another direct debit for a similar amount 
leaving his account each month. But I think it’s reasonable to conclude Mr K would’ve 
noticed he was only paying half of what he expected to each month.
On the whole, I don’t find Mr K’s testimony particularly persuasive. So on balance, I think it’s 
more likely than not Mr K did sign the credit agreement electronically, and that Creation 
provided him with a copy of the agreement, and the letter explaining the arrangement at the 
time of the sale. And even if it didn’t, as I’ve explained, I’d have expected Mr K to make 
enquiries with Creation about this given he was in possession of the furniture before any 
payment was made.
Finally, Mr K says he didn’t receive the reminder letter from Creation in September 2016. I’ve 
seen a sample copy of this letter, and I can see from Creation’s records that this letter was 
sent to Mr K. Creation has explained this was sent to the only address it had for Mr K, and 
although this wasn’t his current address, Mr K has explained this was because he didn’t tell 
Creation he’d moved. 
But in any event, Mr K has said his friend was living at his old address and would’ve passed 
him any post. And if his friend didn’t do this, this isn’t the fault of Creation. I also don’t agree 
that Creation should have done more to ensure that Mr K received this letter and its 
contents; I think that sending this kind of correspondence by second class post is 
reasonable.
Mr K wants Creation to remove the interest and allow him to repay the loan at the amount of 
£2,508. But while I appreciate this will be disappointing for Mr K, for the reasons set out 
above, I won’t be asking Creation to do this, because I don’t think it has done anything 
wrong.
my final decision
For the reasons set out above, I don’t uphold Mr K’s complaint against Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd.

complaint
Ms Q complains about contractual interest Creation Consumer Finance Ltd added to her credit 
agreement when she did not settle it within the ‘buy now pay later’ period. She says she never 
received a reminder letter Creation issued and is unhappy that it will not compromise with her.
our initial conclusions
Our adjudicator found that the date the balance had to be paid by was clear in the agreement Ms Q 
signed. And she was satisfied Creation had sent a reminder letter a month before that date. She 
felt Creation was therefore entitled to hold Ms Q to the terms of the agreement, as she had not 
paid by the required date. Ms Q says she had every intention to pay on time. She feels she is being 
asked to pay an unfair amount of interest for being one month late paying. 
my final decision
I have considered what Ms Q and Creation have said and provided, to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances. Having done so, I do not uphold this complaint. 
I don’t doubt that Ms Q intended to pay before the buy now pay later period ended and that she is 
frustrated with the situation she finds herself in. But she did not pay in time. She says she was the 
victim of unfortunate circumstance and postal problems. However, I accept that Creation did issue 
a reminder letter, which was all it was required to do. As Ms Q did not settle in time the full amount 
of interest became due and Ms Q has not yet paid that interest. I realise Ms Q would now like 
Creation to offer some sort of compromise as a goodwill gesture. But it does not wish to and I 
cannot require it to. Creation has acted in accordance with the terms of the agreement and it is 
entitled to hold Ms Q to those terms. 
I also find that it provided correct information to Ms Q about what she would need to pay to settle 
the agreement early; as well as giving clear dates for when those early settlement quotes expired. 
Creation does not have to now stand by any previous early settlement quotes given, as Ms Q did 
not settle the agreement before those quotes expired.
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint and I make no order or award. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Ms Q either to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2013.

complaint
Mr and Mrs A are unhappy with the quality of a sofa suite they bought from a furniture 
company in 2010. They say that discolouration of the leather has been occurring since about 
October 2011 and it’s now got much worse. They believe the sofa may have been made with 
bonded leather and not genuine leather as they believed. They believe Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd is responsible for this as the lender for the goods. 
background
Mr and Mrs A bought a sofa suite from a furniture supplier, which I’ll call “D” in 2010 using a 
fixed sum loan agreement. The sofa suite was delivered in March 2011. In October 2011, the 
arm of the sofa collapsed and the sofa had spots of discolouration. The sofa was inspected 
and Mr and Mrs A were told the arm had been made with cardboard and this was rectified. 
The spots of discoloration were re-stained. 
Mr and Mrs A say the discolouration has continued over time and they have called D on 
numerous times about this. They were left with some re-staining product so they could 
recolour any areas themselves. But this has now got much worse. Mr and Mrs A did some 
research and discovered their leather sofa suite might not be genuine leather but bonded 
leather. And after discussing this with Citizens Advice, they complained to Creation about 
the quality of the goods as they believed it was responsible for the quality of the goods they 
were sold under the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973. 
Creation upheld the complaint – to the extent that Mr and Mrs A had been offered a recolour 
of the sofa by D and so there were faults and they had received their desired outcome.      
Mr and Mrs A weren’t happy with this and so referred the matter to us. 
Our investigator didn’t think Creation had done anything wrong. She said the Sale of Goods 
Act 1979 applied to this complaint. But as there was no information available from the sale to 
say how the goods were described she was unable to find a misrepresentation of the quality 
of the leather had occurred. And because it was believed the discolouration was linked to 
that, she didn’t find that anything had gone wrong. 
Mr and Mrs A didn’t agree and provided a report from a leather furniture manufacturer who 
believed it possible the type of leather used was wrong. But the investigator stood by her 
original view and so the matter has been referred to me for review and determination.
I issued my provisional decision on 17 April 2018. I said:
The sofa suite was bought using a fixed sum loan agreement. That means neither the 
Sale of Goods Act 1979 nor the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 apply to this 
complaint against Creation. That’s because the ownership of the goods was never passed to 
Creation during the sales process and then sold to Mr and Mrs A as they would be under a 
hire purchase or conditional sale agreement (in these situations Creation would effectively 
be selling the suite not D). However, both of those Acts would apply against D. 
That said Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act does apply to this complaint. That’s 
because Creation lent money to Mr and Mrs A for goods from a supplier it had an existing 
relationship with. Under Section 75 if the debtor, in this case Mr and Mrs A, have a claim 
against the supplier in respect of a misrepresentation or breach of contract, he shall have a 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9699338
--------------------------

like claim against the creditor, who with the supplier, shall accordingly be jointly and 
severally liable to the debtor.   
This means if I find there was a misrepresentation of the goods, or the contract between D 
and Mr and Mrs A was breached, Creation can be held equally liable for any remedy. So I’ve 
considered whether either of these apply. I will deal with each in turn, although there is some 
interlinking. 
Mr and Mrs A believe their leather suite may have been made with bonded leather when 
they thought they had bought genuine leather. I’ve considered the research they’ve done. 
But they haven’t provided any evidence the suite was actually made with bonded leather, 
this is just their belief. They also haven’t been able to provide any of the literature describing 
the product from when it was bought. Creation hasn’t been able to obtain this from D either. 
This isn’t surprising given the sale took place over seven years ago. But without any 
information about how the suite was described in 2010, I’m not persuaded Mr and Mrs A 
have provided persuasive evidence that a misrepresentation has occurred. 
Mr and Mrs A bought the suite from D and that was provided. But if the goods aren’t of 
satisfactory quality then that could amount to a breach of contract. As I have found above, 
there is no information available from the sale about what type of leather the suite was made 
from. And I think this is central to whether or not the goods were of a satisfactory quality. To 
explain, if it was clear the suite was made from bonded leather it wouldn’t be reasonable to 
expect the quality to be the same as genuine leather, or therefore for the goods to last as 
long.
I’ve considered the report Mr and Mrs A have provided. But I don’t find it to be particularly 
comprehensive or therefore persuasive. The report refers to the possibility of belly leather 
being used in the production which isn’t considered usual as it’s prone to splitting and 
cracking. But there is no finding that belly leather has actually been used. And I’m mindful 
this is different to their original belief that bonded leather was used. 
I’ve also considered the comments in the report that if it’s not belly leather, then the leather 
is of an inferior quality as a result of not being tanned or finished properly. So the report 
gives two possible reasons as to why the leather is suffering discolouration. But it makes no 
definitive finding about either. And there is nothing in the report to indicate what the leather 
might be, or is, inferior to. We don’t know what quality of leather the goods were made from 
when they were bought, so there is no persuasive evidence that Mr and Mrs A didn’t get 
what they ordered and paid for. 
Given the price they paid for the suite it seems possible that it was of a lesser quality. But 
this of itself doesn’t mean there has been a misrepresentation or a breach of contract. I’ve 
already found I don’t have any persuasive evidence that the goods they bought were 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs A. And although I can see the cracks in their sofa and what 
appears to be bits of leather coming away (which is very different to their complaint of 
discolouration) this could be down to wear and tear, particularly given the age of the suite. 
Overall I’m not persuaded I’ve seen persuasive evidence the suite wasn’t of satisfactory 
quality when it was bought, such that I would find there’s been a breach of contract. As such 
I’m not persuaded Mr and Mrs A have a claim against Creation for misrepresentation or a 
breach of contract.
Mr and Mrs A don’t agree. In summary, they’ve said:
Ref:

DRN9699338


The leather is actually peeling it’s not just a loss of colour.

Although the report didn’t find it was bonded leather it did find it was leather of inferior 
quality. The sales paperwork refers to leather and it would be expected to be of a 
quality used to manufacture furniture.

Creation upheld the complaint as there were faults. Although a recolour was offered it 
doesn’t last and it doesn’t address the issue of the leather being of an inferior quality. 
No retailers’ state quality of leather at the time of purchase and the customer buys on 
trust.

It was misrepresented at the sale as nowhere does it say inferior quality or second 
grade leather. The sales people might not have been aware of the quality of leather 
used. 

The cracks and peeling away of the leather has been happening since the first year 
of purchase. 
I asked Creation for its comments in relation to point three. It explained the re-colour was 
offered as a gesture of goodwill as Mr and Mrs A were outside of the two year warrantee 
period. The goods are seven years old and there is no evidence of a manufacturing fault. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments, including the responses to my 
provisional decision, to decide what’s fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. Having done so, I’ve found no reason to depart from my provisional findings.
I do understand Mr and Mrs A feel very strongly about this matter. But it remains that they 
haven’t provided any persuasive evidence that the suite they bought was misrepresented to 
them or that it wasn’t of satisfactory quality. 
Mr and Mrs A quite rightly say the suite they bought was described as leather. That is 
correct. And I do accept it doesn’t say inferior quality or second grade leather but it doesn’t 
say anything about the suite being of top quality or top grade leather either. It’s simply 
described as leather and that is what Mr and Mrs A got. So I’m still not persuaded any     
mis-representation occurred. 
There are many different grades of leather that can be used to make furniture, including that 
previously mentioned by Mr and Mrs A of bonded leather. And I think it fair to say that 
furniture made of top grade leather is likely to last longer and command a higher price than 
furniture made of lower quality leather. The report Mr and Mrs A provided does indicate the 
leather is of inferior quality. But there is still no indication of what it was inferior to; if it was 
inferior to top quality leather that doesn’t mean the leather used can’t or shouldn’t have been 
used for making furniture. And it doesn’t persuade me the suite wasn’t of satisfactory quality 
for its price when it was bought. 
I have already acknowledged Mr and Mrs A’s suite appears to be peeling. And although they 
believe I’m at word play, I remain satisfied that is far different to discolouration. 
Discolouration is how Mr and Mrs A described patches on their suite about a year into 
owning it. But discolouration can happen over time and can be dependent on different things 
such as cleaning products and whether a suite sits in sunlight, amongst others. I accept it 
might also be as a result of a defect or fault, but Mr and Mrs A haven’t provided any 
persuasive evidence that’s what happened here or that what they were actually experiencing 
a year in and since was peeling.

This suite was bought a number of years ago. I accept Mr and Mrs A believe it should have 
lasted far longer than it has. But I’ve not seen evidence that would persuade me a 
misrepresentation or breach of contract has occurred that would make Creation liable for any 
remedy. 
my final decision
For the reasons given above, I don’t uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr and Mrs A to

complaint
Mr V complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold him a single 
premium payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy. 
background
In 2006 Mr V bought an electrical item in a shop and he took out a £279.99 loan to pay for it. 
At the same time, Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £91.31 which was added to 
the loan. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr V wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise he’d pay interest (including £81.41 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr V’s complaint. They didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And they didn’t think Mr V would’ve bought the policy if it 
had done so. 
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr V was given 
would’ve made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr V’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr V how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr V to work it out 
for himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr V would expect it to be. And I can’t be sure 
it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his attention was on 
buying his goods – not on buying insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr V better understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr V aware of the effect 
the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay the 
loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest 
at 29.8%. This meant Mr V would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI 
cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover. 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9725010
--------------------------

2

The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr V was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr V would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items. 

I don’t think Mr V would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of how 
much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr V’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr V should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term.
Mr V borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he 
paid more than he should’ve each month. So he needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So, Creation should:

work out and pay Mr V the difference between what he paid each month on the loan 
and what he would’ve paid each month without PPI

add simple interest to the extra amount Mr V paid each month from when he paid it 
until he gets it back (the rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year 
from then on†)

if Mr V made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can deduct what the 
consumer got from what’s due to them.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr V a certificate showing how much tax they’ve taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that Mr V’s complaint is upheld. Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd should pay Mr V fair compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 December 2014.

Complaint
Mr S is unhappy with the response of Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’), following 
a claim against it under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act (‘CCA’) 1974. He also 
complains about charges that have been added to his loan agreement due to late payments.
Background 
In August 2014, My Planet, a company that supplied and installed solar panel systems cold 
called Mr S. Following a meeting at his home with a salesperson, Mr S decided to enter into 
a contract with My Planet for it to supply and install a solar panel system costing around 
£7,800. To fund this he also agreed to enter into a 10 year fixed sum loan agreement with 
Creation. The solar panels were installed soon after.
In December 2016, Mr S made a claim under section 75 (‘s75’) of the CCA to Creation, via 
his representative. The representative said that My Planet had told Mr S that the solar 
panels would be ‘self-funded’ and that the monthly loan repayments would be more than 
offset by the feed-in-tariff (‘FIT’) income. But that hadn’t happened. Instead, Mr S’s monthly 
loan repayments had been much higher.
Creation looked into the concerns. It wrote back to Mr S, via his representative in March 
2017. It didn’t agree that the solar panels had been misrepresented. But, as a gesture of 
goodwill, it offered to reduce the loan agreement and the associated interest by 40%. 
Mr S didn’t accept this and referred his complaint to this Service. While one of our 
investigators was looking into Mr S’s complaint he also raised a further concern as he had 
been receiving up to four calls a day from Creation regarding outstanding arrears on his 
account. Mr S disputed that he was in arrears as he had always made his contractual 
monthly loan repayments and he felt the number of calls excessive. In response to this 
Creation said that Mr S’s payments hadn’t always reached his account when they were due 
and maintained they had been applied correctly.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. She upheld the complaint in part. 
In summary she said:

Mr S’s complaint wasn’t so much about the solar panels themselves but that they had 
been misrepresented as self-funding. To put things right Creation should work out the 
potential savings and income to Mr S over the 10 year term of the loan. It should then 
rework the loan so that he would pay no more than that amount over that term and 
refund any overpayments with 8% simple interest.

Although Mr S wasn’t in arrears he hadn’t always made his monthly contractual 
payments by the time they were required. She was satisfied that the charges and 
interest, accruing from the charges, had been applied in line with the terms and 
conditions of the credit agreement. She acknowledged that Creation had refunded 
some charges in the past as a gesture of goodwill but that this didn’t mean the 
outstanding charges and associated interest should be waived.

Creation used an automated dialling system to call its customers about arrears on 
accounts. And as it had input Mr S’s home number in under the mobile number 
section as well, he was receiving twice the amount of calls that he should. And as Mr 
S had told Creation that he didn’t want it to call him it should have written to him from 
this point. To recognise the trouble and upset this had caused she recommended 
Creation pay £250.

Creation accepted what our investigator had said in full.
Mr S, via his representative, accepted the £250 trouble and upset payment and this has 
already been paid. He also accepted the proposal to make the solar panels self-funding over 
the term of the loan.
He didn’t accept that the charges should’ve been added to his account and asked for an 
ombudsman to review his complaint.
My findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I’ve reached similar conclusions to those of our investigator. I’ll explain why.
self-funding offer
Both parties have agreed with the investigators view that to put things right Creation should 
work out the potential savings to Mr S over the 10 year term of the loan. And it should then 
rework the loan so that Mr S would pay no more than that amount over the 10 year term and 
refund any overpayments with 8% simple interest. I’ve considered whether this is fair, taking 
into account the assumptions and methodology that Creation will use to calculate this 
approach. 
Mr S says he was approached by My Planet and during a sales meeting was told that the 
installation would be entirely self-financing. I haven’t seen anything to suggest that he’d 
shown a previous interest in solar panels before he was approached by My Planet. It’s 
difficult to see why Mr S would agree to the installation of the solar panels financed through 
a loan that would increase his monthly outgoings. I therefore think it’s unlikely that Mr S 
would’ve agreed to install the solar panels and take a loan with Creation unless he was led 
to believe that it would be self-funding and come at no additional financial cost to him.
I’ve also considered the action taken by Renewable Energy Consumer Code (‘RECC’) 
against My Planet. My understanding is that RECC administers the renewable energy 
consumer Code and ensures its members comply with the Code.
The RECC investigated My Planet’s conduct in September 2014 and determined that My 
Planet was in breach of Section 5.2 and Section 5.4 of the Code. These relate to requiring 
members not to provide false or misleading information to consumers and providing clear 
and accurate information about the costs and benefits of the product.  
I accept that what happened in respect of the cases RECC looked into may not have 
necessarily have happened in Mr S’s case. Whilst the RECC findings are general and do not 
refer to Mr S’s case, the findings do suggest that there were conduct concerns in the areas 
that related to Mr S’s complaint and at around the time he was sold the solar panels and 
loan.
Taking the above into account, I believe that it is more likely than not that the salesperson for 
My Planet led Mr S to believe that the solar panels would be self-funding.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9753455
--------------------------

I’m of the opinion that for the solar panels to be self-funding and come at no additional cost 
to Mr S, the savings and income he would receive should have been sufficient to cover the 
repayments due under the loan agreement.
To clarify, Mr S’s expected savings and incomes from the solar panels are from:
(1) generation income tariff,
(2) export tariff income, and;
(3) savings to Mr S by using the electricity generated by the panels instead of buying it 
from his energy provider.
Based on the figures I’ve seen the total expected return from the above three items, in the 
first year, would have come to around £700 whereas the loan repayments were about 
£1,222 a year.
Taking this into account Mr S was likely to be out of pocket by about £522 in the first year. 
And that would have broadly been the same during the term of the loan. This means that 
based on this estimate the solar panels weren’t self-funding. So I’m satisfied that My Planet 
misrepresented the benefits to Mr S.
Mr S didn’t have any prior experience of the solar panel system and he was approached by 
My Planet. I’m satisfied that Mr S decided to go ahead with the purchase of the solar panel 
system based on the representations made by My Planet that the system would be self-
funding. 
For the reasons, I’ve explained above, I find that Mr S has suffered a loss as a result of the 
misrepresentation made by My Planet. The system wasn’t self-funding and Mr S ended up 
paying a significant amount over the savings. And as Creation has equal liability or the 
misrepresentation made by My Planet, I find that it is responsible for Mr S’s loss.
My view of Mr S’s complaint is that it isn’t so much about the solar panels themselves but 
that he was led to believe that they would be self-funding. Based on this I don’t think it would 
be fair or reasonable to require the removal of the solar panels from his home. And it is also 
accepted that it would cost Creation a significant sum to remove them from his home. So I 
don’t think it would be fair or reasonable to ask it to do that. Rather, I’m satisfied that the fair 
outcome here is to put Mr S in a position where the panels are self-funding over the original 
term of the loan. By allowing Mr S to keep the panels, he will likely benefit from lower 
electricity bills of FIT payments going forward.
In cases like this I would expect Creation to apply the methodology that is has agreed with 
our service. To confirm its calculation should be based on the actual performance and 
estimated future performance of Mr S’s solar panel system.
There will be a number of assumptions used when calculating the estimated future 
performance. These include a self-consumption rate of 37%. Based on the Energy Savings 
Trust’s data I’m satisfied that this is reasonable. I think this as it would take into account 
changing consumer occupancy habits over the lifetime of the solar panel system and once 
the loan has been repaid Mr S will continue to likely benefit from the system via lower 
electricity bills or FIT payments.
I’ve also considered the other assumptions Creation has used such as the electricity price 
inflation, the degradation rate and the estimated retail price index (‘RPI’). I’m of the view that 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9753455
--------------------------

4
they don’t seem unreasonable taking into account the actual known figures. As an example 
the actual average RPI for the last 4 years doesn’t seem to be far from the assumed figure.
I’ve also considered any ongoing maintenance costs for Mr S by keeping the solar panels. 
I’ve looked at the information available from the Energy Savings Trust. It says that solar 
panels don’t need a lot of maintenance but usually the inverter would need replacing 
‘sometime’ during the lifetime of the panels at a current cost of about £800. So I accept that 
Mr S could have some maintenance costs over the lifetime of the solar panels. I also accept 
that Mr S would likely have some benefit by way of savings and FIT income going forward.
It’s impossible to know what the extent of those costs and the benefits would actually be. 
However, based on the available information I think that the potential benefit should be 
adequate to offset any reasonable maintenance costs.
In summary, to put things right Creation should recalculate the original loan based on the 
known and assumed savings and income to Mr S from the solar panels over the ten year 
term of the loan so he pays no more than that, and he keeps the solar panel system. 
By recalculating the loan this way, Mr S’s monthly repayments would reduce, meaning that 
he would’ve paid more each month than he should’ve done resulting in an overpayment 
balance. And as a consumer would have been deprived of the monthly overpayment I would 
expect a business to add 8% simple interest from the date of the overpayment to the date of 
settlement. In a case like this, I think the fairest resolution would be to let a consumer have 
the following selection of options as to how they would like their overpayments to be used:
(a) the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and they 
continue to make their current monthly payment resulting in the loan finishing early,
(b) the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and they 
pay a new monthly payment until the end of the loan term,
(c) the overpayments are returned to the consumer and they continue to make their 
current monthly payment resulting in their loan finishing early, or
(d) the overpayments are returned to the consumer and they pay a new monthly 
payment until the end of the loan term.
I also think Creation should pay Mr S £100 for the trouble and upset caused. This is because 
the Renewable Energy Consumer Code, which administers the renewable energy consumer 
Code and ensures its members comply with the Code, had determined that My Planet had 
breached a number of sections of the Code. And because of this I’m satisfied that Creation 
should’ve taken this information, available in the public domain, into account when reviewing 
Mr S’s complaint. I’m of the opinion that this supports Mr S’s claim against Creation and it 
should have upheld his complaint sooner than it did.
charges
Mr S currently has charges of around £70 outstanding on his credit agreement. This is made 
up of a late payment fee, a fee for sending Mr S an arrears letter and interest that has 
accrued on the charges as they haven’t been paid.
I’ve considered the credit agreement Mr S signed when he decided to go ahead with the 
purchase of the solar panels. This sets out the charges that could be added to Mr S’s 
account and explains when they will be charged. Having reviewed the statements for the 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9753455
--------------------------

5
account, I can see that the charges have been applied in line with the terms and conditions 
and I can’t conclude that they have been applied incorrectly.
I accept that Mr S has made a payment each month but the payments need to be made and 
have reached his account by the 18th of each month. And this hasn’t always been the case. I 
understand that Mr S changed to paying by standing order but he still needed to ensure that 
his monthly payment was with Creation by the 18th of each month. I’ve noted that this date 
has now changed to the 26th of each month and Mr S hasn’t incurred any further charges.
On previous occasions Creation has refunded late payment charges and hasn’t always 
charged him when he has been a day or two late and has refunded previous charges as a 
gesture of goodwill. But as I’ve explained above the charges have been applied to the 
account in line with the terms and conditions, which were set out, and that Mr S agreed to. 
Therefore, I’m satisfied they have been added to the account correctly.
My final decision
My final decision is that Mr S’s complaint should be upheld in part. In full and final settlement 
of it, Creation Consumer Finance Ltd should:
(a) allow Mr S to keep the solar panels,
(b) estimate the potential savings and incomes to Mr S from the panels over the ten year 
term of the loan and rework it so he pays no more than this. Where possible, it 
should use Mr S’s electricity bills and FIT statements to do this,
(c) add 8% simple interest* to any overpayment made from the date the overpayment 
was made to date of settlement,
(d) allow Mr S to decide, using the four options given above, how his overpayments 
should be used; and
(e) pay Mr S £100 for the trouble and upset caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2019.

*If Creation Consumer Finance Ltd considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr S how much it’s taken off. It should 
also give Mr S a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so he can claim the tax from HM 
Revenue & Customs.

complaint
Mr H complains, in summary, that Creation Consumer Finance Limited, trading as Creation, 
didn’t deal satisfactorily with the administration of his finance agreement and it unfairly 
applied missed payment markers to his credit file. As a result, he was unable to remortgage 
with a lower interest rate which has caused him financial loss.
background
Mr H entered into a running account credit agreement with Creation on 26 December 2016. 
He bought items using Creation’s account in late December 2016 from a retailer (“R”). They 
were to be repaid by nine monthly direct debit repayments from January 2017. Due to an 
error by R, his account wasn’t activated and his payments weren’t taken by Creation. Mr H 
contacted Creation about this in March 2017. He said that Creation told him that it had no 
agreement with him and that he should speak to R about this, which he did. But as Mr H 
didn’t think he needed to make the repayments at that stage, he spent the money for the 
repayments on his car.
R then told Mr H in June 2017 that the loan repayments would start to be taken in early 
July 2017. Mr H was also told by Creation that the first repayment would be deducted earlier 
than this, on 26 June 2017.
Mr H complained to Creation about the confusion caused by the two different dates, and it 
said that it would put his account on hold for two weeks, and that he didn’t have to make a 
repayment until he received feedback on his complaint. Mr H was then concerned to 
discover that Creation had put a missed payment marker on his credit file. R accepted that it 
had made an error in giving Mr H the wrong repayment date and it paid him an amount 
equivalent to his first two months’ loan repayments in mid-July 2017.
Mr H paid Creation the first two loan repayments on 28 July 2017. He then paid the third 
loan repayment on 20 August 2017. But Creation applied that repayment towards the capital 
balance, and not to his loan repayments. And it applied a further missed payment marker to 
Mr H’s credit file. It also charged Mr H missed payment fees. Mr H hadn’t been told by 
Creation that he needed to make his repayments on the 26th of the month. As he hadn’t, it 
treated the repayment as not having been made. And he wasn’t told about this until after he 
had made his August repayment. So Mr H complained about the further missed payment 
marker on his credit file.
Creation removed the missed payment markers in mid-September 2017 and it refunded the 
missed payment fees.
Mr H spoke to Creation on 26 October 2017 to repay the outstanding balance and was told 
to repay £371.53. He was then surprised to receive a demand from Creation to pay a further 
amount of £5.91. Creation then waived the amount of £5.91 and Mr H’s account was closed.
Mr H was particularly unhappy about the missed payment markers on his credit file as he 
was trying to remortgage at the time and he was concerned that the missed payment 
markers would affect his application. The fixed rate on Mr H’s existing mortgage had ended 
in September 2017, and the interest rate on his mortgage had increased. So he was seeking 
to remortgage elsewhere with a lower rate. As he didn’t receive a new remortgage offer until 
20 November 2017, after the missed payment markers had been removed from his credit 
file, he was obliged to pay two higher monthly repayments in October and November 2017

(around £85 per month higher than his previous monthly repayments) until the remortgage 
was completed. He is seeking a refund of around £170.
our investigator’s view
The investigator agreed that Creation had made errors. He concluded that the combination 
of R’s compensation payment and Creation’s actions in removing the adverse credit file 
entries and refunding the charges was fair redress for Mr H’s complaint.
Mr H responded to say, in summary, that the investigator hadn’t investigated all his 
concerns. He was disappointed by the investigator’s view and believed that the investigator 
agreed that Creation could treat him as it wished. He also said that a remortgage offer at a 
lower interest rate had been delayed due to the incorrect missed payment entries on his 
credit file. He was also taking legal advice about the matter.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr H 
and to Creation on 26 March 2018. I summarise my findings:
It was clear to me that the initial errors in this complaint were due to R’s failure to activate 
Mr H’s account and its error in telling Mr H the wrong payment date. I noted that R had 
provided compensation to Mr H for this.
I also noted that Mr H felt that Creation shouldn’t have referred him back to R when it had 
told him that his agreement had been cancelled. But Creation had told us that this was the 
correct process as he had returned purchases to R.
But, after seeking more information from Creation and Mr H, and listening to recordings of 13 
of the phone calls between Mr H and Creation, I’d thought that Creation had also made 
mistakes in administering the finance agreement.
I’d referred to the calls we’d received by their numbering. I’d thought the issues were as 
follows:
1. Creation had told Mr H that his account would be put on hold in June 2017 (call 1) for two 
weeks, and that he needn’t make a payment until he’d received feedback on his complaint, 
which would take around a week. But I’d noted that a final response letter wasn’t provided 
until early September 2017. Despite this reassurance, I noted that Creation had put a late 
payment marker on Mr H’s credit file. But Mr H had understood that no action would be 
taken whilst his complaint was being investigated. Creation had also told this service that a 
hold wasn’t put on the account in June 2017.
2. It had provided incorrect information to Mr H about his outstanding balance (call 3) when 
fees should have been written off as previously agreed.
3. It had failed to tell Mr H that his payments had to be made on the 26th of each month until 
after his August 2017 payment. As it didn’t tell Mr H this, his mid-August repayment wasn’t 
taken as his contractual monthly repayment, but instead was credited to his balance. As a 
result Creation had put a further missed payment marker on his credit file even though the 
repayment had been made.
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9756134
--------------------------

3
I’d seen copies of Creation’s monthly statements and these referred to payments having to 
be made by the 26th of the relevant month. So, I could see that these weren’t clear that the 
payments had to be made on the 26th of the month.
I’d also seen a copy of the credit agreement dated 26 December 2016 and the agreement 
terms and conditions. These had referred to the payments having to be made on a fixed 
date. But I noted that Mr H said that he never received the agreement. I noted that Creation 
had told us that Mr H would have been given a copy of the agreement and terms and 
conditions. But the screen it had sent us about this said “Agreement has been esigned but 
no paper work received”. This appeared to indicate that Mr H didn’t get copies of the 
agreement documents. So, I could see that he mightn’t have known about the need to make 
repayments on a fixed date.
4. It had failed to tell Mr H that a further payment in respect of continued daily interest would 
be needed to pay off the whole outstanding balance (although this was later waived).
5. It had told Mr H that he wasn’t in arrears with his payments (on call 8) but he was told on a 
phone call (call 9) that he was in arrears.
6. It had sent Mr H an arrears letter on 28 June 2017 when Mr H had understood he didn’t 
have to make a payment until early July 2017. The letter didn’t make any reference to a late 
payment marker being added to his credit file.
I noted from listening to the 13 calls that Mr H became extremely frustrated by Creation’s 
actions. He had to keep explaining the situation to Creation’s staff, and became exasperated 
that it was providing him with incorrect information. He was especially upset as he thought 
that Creation’s adverse credit file entries would affect his ability to remortgage. I could also 
see that he believed that Creation’s staff was patronising towards him. I also could see that 
Mr H had spent a considerable time on the calls and trying to resolve the matter.
As a result of Creation’s mistakes in administering the finance agreement, I’d thought that 
Creation should pay £200 compensation to Mr H for his distress and inconvenience as a 
result of its actions.
I’d also noted that Mr H had told Creation that he was trying to remortgage. Mr H’s mortgage 
broker said that Mr H had made two remortgage applications in July 2017 which had initially 
been declined. But after Creation had removed its adverse entries, Mr H had received a 
remortgage offer in late November 2017.
But I’d also seen a copy of Mr H’s credit file. I’d seen that there was a note on the file to 
show that he was disputing Creation’s missed payment entries. But I’d also noted that Mr H 
had missed a payment on a credit card in the previous twelve months, and in the previous 
24 months there were missed payments on another credit account and a utility account. 
I thought that it was possible that entries such as these might have affected a remortgage 
application. In addition, I’d said that I was also aware that lenders used a variety of sources, 
including credit files, to establish their lending criteria. So, it was also possible that any 
remortgage declines might have been due to other reasons.
I’d also noted that Mr H’s remortgage offer was for a higher amount than his current 
mortgage, so this too might have affected potential lenders’ decisions. I’d also noted that one 
lender in mid-October 2017 had declined the remortgage application as the amount of the 
loan compared to the value of the property exceeded its policy lending criteria. So, this 
Ref: 
--------------------------
DRN9756134
--------------------------

4
supported my view that Creation’s late payment markers might not have been the sole 
reason for Mr H’s remortgage difficulties.
So, for these reasons, I wasn’t persuaded that I could safely conclude that it was due to the 
Creation entries alone that Mr H was unable to remortgage. So, I didn’t propose to order 
Creation to refund the difference in the two months’ mortgage repayments.
Subject to any further representations by Mr H or Creation my provisional decision was that 
I intended to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to order Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited, trading as Creation, to pay £200 compensation to Mr H for distress and 
inconvenience.
Mr H responded to say that he was happy with the outcome.
Creation responded to say that it agreed with the outcome and that the compensation 
amount took into consideration the inconvenience Mr H had regrettably incurred. It also 
referred to the following part of my decision:
“I could also see that he believed that Creation’s staff was patronising towards him. I also 
could see that Mr H had spent a considerable time on the calls and trying to resolve the 
matter.”
Creation asked for staff feedback purposes whether this was in relation to a specific 
complaint or whether it was the overall feel from the calls.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that Creation had referred to part of my decision concerning its calls with Mr H and 
asked whether I was referring to a specific complaint in my comments or whether it was an 
overall feel. I recall that Mr H had specifically remarked in one of the calls I’d listened to that 
the staff member was being patronising towards him. So, I think that Mr H was referring to a 
specific call.
Otherwise, neither of the parties has provided any further information in response to my 
provisional decision. So I’m satisfied that the proposed resolution in my provisional decision 
is fair in all the circumstances, and I find no basis to depart from my earlier conclusions.
my final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of it, I order 
Creation Consumer Finance Limited, trading as Creation, to pay £200 compensation to Mr H 
for distress and inconvenience.
Creation must pay the compensation within 28 days of the date on which we tell it Mr H 
accepts my final decision. If it pays later than this it must also pay interest on the 
compensation from the date of my final decision to the date of payment at 8% a year simple.
If Creation considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Mr H how much it’s taken off. It should also give Mr H a tax

deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2018.

complaint
Mr A complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd has failed to deal fairly with him, 
following financial difficulties.
 
background 
Mr A had loan and card accounts with Creation. Following financial difficulties, he says that 
Creation has repeatedly written to him with incorrect information and threats of collections. 
He also says Creation has not responded to his enquiries about how the debt had been 
calculated, has applied unfair charges and has taken an inconsistent approach to waiving 
interest.
Mr A considers that the way Creation has dealt with him, including failure to deal with his 
accounts together and refusing to register default, has added further to his problems. As 
things were not settled between Mr A and Creation, Mr A brought his complaint to this 
service where an adjudicator investigated it. Mr A also said that he had not received annual 
statements on his loan account, and questioned whether that affected Creation’s ability to 
charge interest. 
After discussions with both Mr A and Creation, the adjudicator proposed the following 
settlement:

the fixed-sum loan account should be defaulted backdated to 31 July 2015;

two credit card accounts should be defaulted backdated to October 2014; and

Mr A should receive compensation of £150.
When arriving at that proposal, the adjudicator took account of refunds and interest 
suspensions that had already been provided on Mr A’s account, and also that the annual 
loan statements appeared to have been issued by Creation to the correct address.
Creation agreed to offer the proposed redress. Mr A was initially not convinced this went far 
enough to settle things fairly, but decided on reflection to accept the proposal and returned 
our signed settlement form.
The adjudicator forwarded the signed form to Creation, to enable it to finalise the settlement. 
Creation then wrote to say that it had paid the £150 to Mr A but, having reviewed the case in 
the light of information regulatory guidelines, it now did not consider that it could add a 
default while the relationship with Mr A continued and he was maintaining any form of 
payments under an arrangement. Given that this went against what it had previously agreed 
to do, it said it would pay further compensation of £300.
The adjudicator did not consider that Creation was prevented from applying the defaults as 
agreed. She was also concerned that, having made Mr A wait for a considerable length of 
time while it considered and then accepted the settlement proposals, it had subsequently 
gone back on what it had agreed to do.

Mr A said he found Creation’s stance frustrating and unhelpful, and felt it was not giving 
sufficient consideration to his long-term financial hardship. In the light of the overall situation, 
the complaint was referred for decision by an ombudsman.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There’s no doubt that Mr A has found it very difficult to communicate with Creation about his 
accounts, and to explore what arrangements could be made following his becoming unable 
to support his contractual repayments. 
From the evidence, I am satisfied that Creation did not coordinate its administration of the 
accounts and seems to have relied on standard letters which did not take into account the 
actual position here.
Mr A is in arrears and has paid reduced amounts for a considerable period of time. While 
there have been payment arrangements, the fact is that he has not been able to return to the 
contractual repayments and – given the further setback he has now experienced when his 
job was made redundant – there seems no reasonable prospect of his ever being able to do 
so. 
Given the situation that has applied here, I do not see that Creation would breach any 
information regulatory guidelines in registering the defaults as agreed with the adjudicator. I 
also note that Creation did not raise this issue at all until a considerable length of time had 
elapsed and it had already agreed to the proposed settlement. Creation was certainly given 
plenty of time to consider all this, before it made its offer.
The other decision to which Creation refers does not directly assist it, since the point in this 
case is that the adjudicator arrived at what she viewed as a broadly fair outcome to address 
Mr A’s complaint, which Creation offered and Mr A accepted. In all the circumstances, I am 
not persuaded that Creation is prevented from putting into effect the resolution which it 
agreed to provide. 
Taking everything into account, including the extended time during which Creation has made 
Mr A wait while it went back on its previous agreement, I consider that the fair outcome for 
this case is that Creation should default the accounts as it has previously agreed to do and 
should also pay Mr A the additional compensation it has now offered.
Backdating the defaults will not result in any interest adjustment on the fixed sum loan 
agreement, because of the way that product is structured. But interest charged after 
1 October 2014 on the relevant credit card accounts (which are Mr A’s ASDA card and his 
Direct Credit card) will need to be adjusted, back-dated to the date of default.

my final decision
My final decision is that I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd to:

apply a default to the fixed-sum loan account, backdated to 31 July 2015;

apply defaults to the two credit card accounts backdated to 1 October 2014, making 
the appropriate interest rebates; and

pay Mr A a further £300.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 August 2016.

complaint
Mrs S complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd failed to reduce the instalments under 
a fixed term loan agreement following a credit to the account.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy of which is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained why I proposed to uphold Mrs S’s complaint and to 
require Creation to pay the sum of £848 to Mrs S in respect of the cancelled items, together 
with a further £300 compensation for trouble and upset. This was on the basis that the fixed 
term loan agreement ran its course.
I invited Mrs S and Creation to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted 
to make before I finally determined the matter. 
Creation didn’t respond to my provisional decision. 
Mrs S asked me to take into account the fact that by not having reduced payments she had 
been placed under a financial burden as she had purchased the items which could not be 
supplied from an alternative supplier and had entered into another finance agreement. Mrs S 
said she didn’t accept that Creation was unable to settle the initial agreement and set up a 
new agreement. Mrs S said she accepted the £848 refund but didn’t feel that £300 was 
sufficient compensation.
my findings
I’ve reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I’ve taken account of Mrs S’s further comments and I understand what a distressing time this 
has been for her. But I’m not persuaded that I should reach a different conclusion to the one 
set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For the reasons set out in detail in my provisional decision, my final decision is to uphold the 
complaint.

K820x#14
complaint
Mr H complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd will not give him a refund and cancel 
his finance agreement.  He brings this complaint through his representative – T.
For ease, I will refer to all submissions as if made by Mr H direct.
background
In July 2013, Mr H entered into an agreement to have solar panels fitted to his property.  He 
says he was told that the system would be self-funding and that his savings could be used to 
pay off his finance sooner if he chose to do so.
But Mr H says that his savings have not been as he expected and so he complained to 
Creation.  He said that the level of savings had been misrepresented to him.  To rectify the 
situation, he wanted to cancel the finance agreement, have the panels removed and be 
refunded for all payments he had already made.
His complaint was rejected so he brought it to this service.
Our adjudicator didn’t think she could ask Creation to do as Mr H was requesting and so he 
asked for an ombudsman’s decision.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H paid for the panels using a loan.  Because of the way he paid, in some circumstances 
he could be protected by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. And that could mean 
he was entitled to a refund. This is because Section 75 says that Creation is responsible for 
any incorrect information that the supplier gave to him - provided this information is what 
made him agree to have the panels installed and take out the loan. 
So, I need to decide whether this is what happened in Mr H’s case.
I am afraid that based on what I have seen, I cannot be satisfied that he was given incorrect 
information.  I say that because I have only seen very few documents from the meeting 
which Mr H had with the sales person.  Our adjudicator did request further information from 
him – such as bills to show what his energy usage was before and after the solar panels had 
been fitted – but I am afraid nothing transpired.
And when an ombudsman’s decision was requested on behalf of Mr H, I note that no further 
submissions were received on his behalf.
In the circumstances, I cannot uphold Mr H’s complaint and so, I will not be asking Creation 
to terminate its finance agreement with him.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
