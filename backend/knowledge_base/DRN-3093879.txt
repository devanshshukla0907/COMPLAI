The complaint
Mr A complains about the way that a refund for goods that he paid for using credit provided 
by Creation Consumer Finance Limited has been dealt with.
What happened
Mr A used a credit agreement with Creation Consumer Finance, that he electronically signed 
in August 2018, to pay a total of £3,186.57 for a television, a sound bar and some related 
items. He returned the sound bar to the retailer in December 2018 and it refunded the 
£199.99 that he’d paid for it, and a further £170, to his credit card. He complained to the 
retailer in September 2020 that the credit for the sound bar hadn’t been taken off his credit 
agreement.
The retailer said that a refund for the sound bar had been made to Mr A’s credit card so 
wouldn’t also be removed from his credit agreement but it said that it was happy for him to 
keep the extra £170 that had been refunded to him by mistake (which it said would cover the 
interest that he would have been charged on the sound bar) and it offered him £50 
compensation for the poor service that he’d received in store. 
Mr A wasn’t satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didn’t 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She thought that the retailer had been fair 
and handled Mr A’s complaint in a reasonable manner. Mr A has asked for his complaint to 
be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the £170 was for the poor service of the 
fitting of the television (which was originally £299) and he didn’t receive the £50 
compensation so he’s still lost interest, which he wasn’t made aware of, and he’s been 
caused inconvenience by what he had to go through.
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:

the retailer has provided evidence to show it refunded the cost of the sound bar to 
Mr A’s credit card and that Mr A also received a further refund of £170 which was 
made in error – Mr A says that the £170 was compensation for the poor service that 
he’d received relating to the fitting of the television – but he’s not provided any other 
evidence to show that it was paid to him as compensation and the retailer says that it 
has no record of compensation of £170 being agreed with Mr A;

the retailer said that it was happy for Mr A to keep the extra £170 (which it said would 
cover the interest that he would have been charged on the sound bar) and it offered 
him £50 compensation for the poor service that he’d received in store, which it said 
would be paid to him by bank transfer;

Mr A says that he was offered a £50 voucher, which he didn’t accept, and that he 
hasn’t received the £50 compensation;

Creation Consumer Finance says that it’s unable to remove items from the 
agreement and would need the retailer to process or notify it of any amendments that 
needed to be made – but it’s received no notification from the retailer about a refund 
to Mr A’s agreement and it says that he’s received the £170 in error and been offered 
£50 compensation so has been placed into a position of financial advantage;

in complaints such as this one, where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or 
contradictory, I have to make my decision on the balance of probabilities – in other 
words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available 
evidence and the wider circumstances;

I consider it to be more likely than not that the retailer refunded the price of the sound 
bar to Mr A’s credit card – and that it also refunded a further £170 to him in error – 
but I consider that it should have amended his credit agreement to remove the 
charge for the sound bar from the agreement;

as Mr A has received a refund for the price of the sound bar, it wouldn’t now be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer Finance to remove the charge for 
the sound bar from his agreement as if it did that Mr A would, in effect, have received 
the refund twice;

Mr A is still paying interest on the price of the sound bar under the agreement – but 
£369.99 was refunded to his credit card in December 2018 and he’s had the benefit 
of that refund since then which will have reduced the interest that he was paying on 
his credit card;

I consider that the retailer’s response to Mr A’s complaint was fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances and, if he now wishes to receive the £50 compensation that it 
offered to him, I suggest that he contacts the retailer to ask it if the compensation is 
still available to him; and

I find that it wouldn’t be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer 
Finance to pay that compensation, or any other compensation, to Mr A or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I don’t uphold Mr A’s complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2021.
