The complaint
Mr S complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd rejected the claim he made under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (“the Act”) in relation to a solar panel system he 
said was misrepresented to him by the supplier.
Mr S is represented by a claims management company (“the CMC”).
What happened
In or around May 2016 Mr S was cold called by a company I’ll call “G” to talk about 
purchasing a solar panel system (“the system”) to be installed at his home.
After being visited by a representative of G, Mr S decided to purchase the system and 
finance it through a 10 year (120 months) fixed sum loan agreement with Creation. The 
monthly loan repayments were £109.88. The system was subsequently installed.
In January 2017 Mr S paid off the outstanding Creation loan as the system wasn’t generating 
the benefits he’d expected, and he wanted to reduce his costs. He consolidated this and 
some existing lending by taking out another loan (Loan 2). Loan 2 had a slightly higher 
interest rate but a significantly shorter term (60 months).
In June 2017 the CMC made a claim on Mr S’s behalf under section 75 of the Act. The CMC 
said G’s sales representative had made a number of misrepresentations to Mr S which had 
induced him to enter into the sales contract and finance agreement. In summary the CMC 
said Mr S had been told the system was “self-funding”, but that since it had been installed 
the Feed in Tariff (FIT) payments he’d received and the savings he’d made on his electricity 
had fallen far short of his monthly finance payments.
Creation rejected Mr S’s claim. They didn’t agree that the system had been misrepresented.
Our investigator’s view on misrepresentation
One of our investigators looked into what had happened and upheld Mr S’s complaint. She 
didn’t think the information provided to Mr S about the income and savings he could expect 
from the panels was clear enough for him to realise that what the system generated wouldn’t 
cover the cost of the loan.
To put things right our investigator said Creation should recalculate the loan based on the 
known and assumed savings and income generated by the system over the 10-year term of 
the loan so that Mr S pays no more than that. And pay Mr S £100 compensation.
Creation initially didn’t accept this outcome. But our investigator didn’t change her opinion. 
She said G had a responsibility to communicate information to Mr S in a way that was clear, 
fair and not misleading. She later highlighted some comments made by G to Creation which 
suggested the salesperson had told Mr S the cost of the system would be recouped through 
“a combination of all savings and earnings” and that he’d only have to “top up the difference” 
between the benefits and repayments in the “first few years”.
Offer
Creation then made an offer to settle the claim. Creation’s offer was to make the system self-
funding. They calculated that the savings and income Mr S would likely receive from the 
system over the 10-year term of the loan would be £2,722.21. As he’d paid Creation 
£8,981.04 in total, Creation offered him a refund of £6,258.83 plus 8% interest.
The CMC didn’t agree that this fully compensated Mr S because he’d refinanced his 
Creation loan by taking out Loan 2. They said Mr S had incurred a further £2,796.69 in 
interest as a result of Loan 2, meaning he’d actually paid £11,777.73 for the system.
Our investigator’s view on Creation’s offer (August 2020)
Our investigator agreed with the CMC that the cost of Loan 2 should be taken into account. 
Simply put, she said Creation should make sure Mr S pays no more than the savings and 
income he’ll likely receive from the system over the 10-year term of the Creation loan, and 
pay Mr S 8% simple interest per year on each overpayment he’s made until the date 
Creation refunds it. She provided the following detail to inform how the remedy should be 
calculated:

Mr S borrowed £13,185.88 from Creation (including interest and other fees) to pay for 
the solar panels.

Mr S made seven monthly payments of £109.88 (totalling £769.16) before settling the 
Creation loan. He paid £8,981.04 in total.

Creation calculated the total expected benefits from the system over the 10-year term 
of the loan as £2,722.21. Therefore, the monthly payment should’ve been £22.68 
(£2,722.21 divided by 120).

This means that Mr S paid an extra £87.20 each month when paying the Creation 
loan (£610.40 in total).

To compensate him for being out of pocket, Creation should refund this with simple 
interest at 8% per year from the date of each payment until he gets the refund.

Mr S borrowed a further £13,932.60 (including interest and other fees) from another 
lender (Loan 2) – the capital borrowed was £10,392.93.

To settle his Creation loan he’d used 79% of Loan 2 (£8,211.88).

The term of Loan 2 is five years (60 months) and the monthly repayment is £232.21.

79% of the monthly repayment is for the solar panel system (£183.45).

When what’s left of the total expected benefits is adjusted to reflect the term of Loan 
2, the monthly payment for the system should be £42.72. (The total expected benefit 
is £2,722.21. £158.76 has already been accounted for [£22.68 multiplied by seven], 
which means that £2,563.45 is left. The term of Loan 2 is 60 months - £2,563.45 
divided by 60 is £42.72).

This means that Mr S has paid an extra £140.73 each month when he’s made his 
Loan 2 repayments.

To compensate him for being out of pocket, Creation should refund this with simple 
interest at 8% per year from the date of each payment until he gets the refund.
With regard to Mr S’s future Loan 2 repayments, at the point at which our investigator issued 
her view (August 2020) Mr S still had 18 months of payments outstanding and, assuming 
he’d made all his Loan 2 payments, still owed £3,302.10 of what he’d used to pay for the 
solar panel system. So, our investigator said Creation should pay Mr S £2,533.14 leaving 
him with 18 payments of £42.72 left to make (£768.96).
Creation agreed to this methodology in January 2021 and calculated the offer they’d make to 
Mr S as £10,639.35.
Mr S agreed in principle with what the investigator had said but asked to see the calculations 
in full before accepting. Unfortunately, when we asked Creation for a detailed calculation 
what they sent us in July 2021 didn’t appear to match the offer they’d made in January 2021 
and didn’t take into account that Mr S had settled his Creation loan in January 2017 and 
refinanced.
As we received no further calculation from Creation the complaint has come to me to decide.
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I note that Creation have indicated their acceptance of Mr S’s original 
complaint that the system was misrepresented to him at the point of sale. And they’ve 
offered to remedy that with an offer to make the system self-funding. So, instead of 
examining the sale of the system and whether it was misrepresented to Mr S I’ve only 
considered whether, in the circumstances that both parties accept that point, the offer made 
by Creation is fair.
As we’ve been made aware by the CMC that Mr S refinanced the Creation loan in January 
2017 with Loan 2, I find that the first offer made by Creation (a refund of £6,258.83 plus 8% 
interest) didn’t adequately compensate Mr S. This is because it didn’t take into account any 
of the costs Mr S incurred associated with Loan 2.
I think it’s important when considering if this offer is fair, to ensure that Mr S doesn’t 
experience any financial loss as a result of the misrepresentation. Mr S refinanced the 
Creation loan with Loan 2 to reduce his costs because the system was not proving to be 
self-funding as promised. So, I think Creation needs to make sure that, including the 
refinance loan, the consumer pays no more than the benefits he’ll likely get from the system 
over the original loan term (in this case, 10 years).
Putting things right
In line with that approach I agree with what our investigator set out as a fair way of putting 
things right when she provided her view in August 2020. I’ve set out the detail that our 
investigator provided above, and I remain of the view that this detail should inform how the 
remedy is calculated. In summary, Creation should:

Refund the overpayment of £87.20 Mr S paid each month towards the Creation loan.

Add 8% simple interest from the date of each overpayment until Mr S receives his 
refund.

Refund the overpayment of £140.73 Mr S has paid each month towards Loan 2.

Add 8% simple interest from the date of each overpayment until Mr S receives his 
refund.

Pay Mr S £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused to him by what happened.
Future payments towards Loan 2
Some time has passed since our investigator issued her second view. At that time Mr S still 
had 18 months to go with his payments towards Loan 2. So, the figures she included relating 
to future payments Mr S would have to make on Loan 2 are now out of date, but I support 
the methodology she used to say how Mr S should be compensated in relation to future 
payments.
Bringing things up to date, Mr S is nearing the end of the 60-month term of Loan 2 in early 
2022. As this is the case, I think Creation should confirm with Mr S how many monthly 
payments he has left to make, and then add to the refund the overpayment portion of each 
of those future payments (i.e. £140.73 for each monthly payment). Creation don’t need to 
add 8% simple interest to this amount as it’s for future payments, not overpayments he’s 
already made and therefore been out of pocket for.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr S’s complaint. I direct Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to:

Refund the overpayment of £87.20 Mr S paid each month towards the Creation loan, 
adding 8% simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr S receives his 
refund;

Refund the overpayment of £140.73 Mr S has paid each month towards Loan 2, 
adding 8% simple interest from the date of each payment until Mr S receives his 
refund;

Pay Mr S an amount of £140.73 for each monthly payment he’s still to make towards 
Loan 2 under the original 60-month agreement;

Pay Mr S £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused to him by what happened; 
and

Provide Mr S with a full calculation of the refund and interest payments.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2022.
