complaint
Mr S complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd didn’t send him annual statements for 
his loan account.
background
Mr S took out the loan in July 2013. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd said a third party, acting 
on its behalf, sent him the statements on each anniversary of the loan agreement.
The adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. She asked Creation 
Consumer Finance for evidence that it’d sent annual statements to Mr S but it said it didn’t 
have any. She issued her opinion letter and then Creation said it had evidence that it’d sent 
Mr S an annual statement in August 2014.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I’ve seen the evidence Creation relies on but although it gives a statement end date of 
4 August 2014 I don’t think that’s sufficient to show it sent the statement to Mr S. So I have 
come to the same conclusions as the adjudicator for much the same reasons.
Creation Consumer Finance has an obligation to send Mr S annual statements for his loan 
account. It can’t provide any evidence it has done so. In light of section 77A of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 I’m satisfied it should refund Mr S the interest it’s charged him from 
July 2013 to July 2015.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement I require Creation Consumer Finance Ltd 
to pay Mr S:

All interest payments on his loan account from 21 July 2013 to 21 July 2015.

£50 compensation for the inconvenience it’s caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2016.
