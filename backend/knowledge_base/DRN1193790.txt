complaint
Mr G complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd has charged him interest on buy now 
pay later credit when he had paid it in full.
background
Mr G took out a buy now pay later agreement on 19 February 2007 and on 18 December 
2008 his direct debit was cancelled. Mr G was required to pay the credit off by 20 December 
2008 to avoid an interest charge. He made payment of £319.68 on 22 December and on 29 
November 2010 an arrears letter was sent. In the following months Mr G made two 
payments which left an outstanding sum of £ 306.46.
In May 2016 Creation transferred the debt to a collection agency and it sought payment from 
him. Mr G complained to Creation, but it rejected his complaint and so the matter as brought 
to this service. It was considered by one of our investigators who didn’t recommend it be 
upheld. 
She obtained the original agreement which was dated 19 December 2007. It was for 
£299.96 with interest 32.4% payable over 48 months (total amount payable was £668.64). 
The first instalment of £13.93 was to be made on 26 December 2008, followed by 46 
monthly instalments of £13.93 payable on the same day each month and a final instalment 
of £13.93 on 26 November 2012.
Alternatively, Mr G could make a one off payment of £319.98 payable on or before 20 
December 2008 (special offer date payment). She noted Mr G made payment of £319.98 on 
22 December 2008. This was after the special offer date and so he was obliged to pay the 
full amount of £668.64.
She noted a statement sent to Mr G from September 2009 which indicates that the 
agreement date was 28 December 2007, rather than 19 December 2007. She accepted that 
Mr G might have been confused about the date of the agreement, but she pointed out the 
statement didn’t refer to the special offer date. In any event this statement was received after 
the special offer date and so had no bearing on his late payment. 
She also said that Mr G had previously taken out similar loans with Creation, and paid these 
by the special offer date to avoid paying interest on the loan, so it was likely that he was 
familiar with the process.
Creation had said that on two previous occasions where payment was made after the 
special offer date it had foregone the interest as a gesture of goodwill. She thought Mr G 
should have been aware of the importance of making his payment on time.
Mr G didn’t agree and said Creation shouldn’t have taken his payment if it wasn’t going to 
clear his debt. He thought it had taken the money in settlement of his debt. He wasn’t aware 
he owned more money until 2010.
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.

Mr G entered into an agreement which he signed on 19 December 2007 which said he 
agreed to pay the sum of £688.04. This agreement clearly states that if he repays the capital 
sum borrowed plus a fee of £20 by 20 December 2008 he does not have to pay interest. 
There is no ambiguity about the agreement and given he had entered into similar 
agreements in the past I think it reasonable to conclude Mr G was aware of what was 
required.
He failed to meet his side of the bargain and so Creation is entitled to charge him the full 
amount of interest. I see a later statement refers to the agreement being made on 27 
December, but that was sent to him after the due date and so has no bearing on the matter. 
Mr G should have been aware of the date payment was due or if he wasn’t he should have 
been.
It is unfortunate that Creation didn’t tell Mr G at the time that he had missed the due date 
and simply allocated his payment against the money due. However, if it had done so it 
wouldn’t have changed the positon. He still would have missed the payment date and he 
would still have owed the interest.
Creation was owed money by Mr G and he paid it some of that money in December 2008 
and so it was fully entitled to cash the cheque and put it against the money due. Cashing the 
cheque didn’t imply that the debt was satisfied. I cannot see any basis for upholding this 
complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr G to accept or reject my decision before 15 
September 2019.
