complaint
Mr V complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (‘Creation’) mis-sold him a single 
premium payment protection insurance (‘PPI’) policy. 
background
In 2006 Mr V bought an electrical item in a shop and he took out a £279.99 loan to pay for it. 
At the same time, Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £91.31 which was added to 
the loan. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr V wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise he’d pay interest (including £81.41 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr V’s complaint. They didn’t think Creation had properly explained 
how much the policy would cost. And they didn’t think Mr V would’ve bought the policy if it 
had done so. 
Creation disagreed. It said the loan agreement and other paperwork Mr V was given 
would’ve made him aware of what the policy cost. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr V’s complaint because I agree with the adjudicator that Creation 
didn’t properly tell Mr V how much the policy cost. I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. And it wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr V to work it out 
for himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr V would expect it to be. And I can’t be sure 
it was drawn to his attention, particularly when he was in a shop and his attention was on 
buying his goods – not on buying insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr V better understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement wasn’t enough to make Mr V aware of the effect 
the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay the 
loan off during the first 12 months the whole amount, including the PPI, attracted interest 
at 29.8%. This meant Mr V would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on the PPI 
cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover.


The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr V was borrowing. This was unusual and I think 
Mr V would have seen it as important information when deciding whether to buy the 
policy. Especially as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items. 

I don’t think Mr V would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of how 
much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr V’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr V should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term.
Mr V borrowed extra to pay for the PPI, so his loan was bigger than it should’ve been and he 
paid more than he should’ve each month. So he needs to get back the extra he’s paid. 
So, Creation should:

work out and pay Mr V the difference between what he paid each month on the loan 
and what he would’ve paid each month without PPI

add simple interest to the extra amount Mr V paid each month from when he paid it 
until he gets it back (the rate of interest is 15% a year until April 1993 and 8% a year 
from then on†)

if Mr V made a successful claim under the PPI policy, Creation can deduct what the 
consumer got from what’s due to them.
† HM Revenue & Customs requires Creation to take off tax from this interest. Creation must 
give Mr V a certificate showing how much tax they’ve taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that Mr V’s complaint is upheld. Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd should pay Mr V fair compensation as I’ve set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 December 2014.
