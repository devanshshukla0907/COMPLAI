The complaint
Mr A complains that a computer that he paid for using credit from Creation Consumer 
Finance Limited was misrepresented to him.
What happened
Mr A bought a computer, mouse and keyboard from a retailer in November 2020 as a 
Christmas present for his daughter to play games on. The price of the computer was £499 
and the total cost of the three items was £663.99 which was applied to Mr A’s credit account 
with Creation Consumer Finance. 
He says that he’d been advised by the retailer in an online chat that the computer was 
suitable for gaming and he visited one of the retailer’s store where he was told that the 
computer was suitable for gaming. He then bought the computer online but, when it was set-
up, his daughter couldn’t play the games that she wanted to play on it. Mr A says that he 
tried to contact the retailer by phone but couldn’t get through to speak to it and he was 
prepared to pay more for a suitable computer. 
He then complained to Creation Consumer Finance but it rejected his claim. It said that the 
webpage for this computer makes no mention of gaming and, as this was an online non-
advised sale, it would expect the customer to check the advert and specification to ensure it 
was suitable for their needs. It said that it would need to see evidence that information 
provided by the retailer prior to the sale influenced the decision to buy the computer for it to 
be able to review the matter further.
Mr A wasn’t satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didn’t 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that there was no evidence of a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation with the purchase which meant that there was no 
available claim.
Mr A has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He questions what 
evidence he can provide to show that the computer was misrepresented to him and he says, 
in summary and amongst other things, that:

he’s made lots of other purchases from the retailer using his credit account and not 
complained about any of them;

the receipt shows a gaming mouse, a gaming keyboard and the computer so it was 
likely that the computer was going to be used to play games;

the retailer and Creation Consumer Finance both have provided appalling customer 
service; and

if the computer hadn’t been misrepresented to him he wouldn’t have wanted to return 
it and pay more for a suitable computer. 
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:

Mr A used credit provided by Creation Consumer Finance to pay for the computer 
and other items - in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if there’s been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier;

to be able to uphold Mr A’s complaint about Creation Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the retailer 
and that Creation Consumer Finance‘s response to his claim under section 75 wasn’t 
fair or reasonable – but I’m not determining the outcome of Mr A’s claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;

Mr A says that he was advised by the retailer online that the computer was suitable 
for gaming and that he visited the supplier’s store where he was also told that the 
computer was suitable for gaming – and he says that he bought a gaming mouse and 
keyboard with the computer so it was likely that the computer would be used to play 
games - but he’s not been able to provide any documentary or other evidence to 
show that he was advised that the computer was suitable for gaming;

Creation Consumer Finance says that this was an online, non-advised sale so it 
would expect Mr A to have checked the advert and specification to ensure that the 
computer was suitable for his needs;

it also says that the webpage for the computer describes it as being suitable for: 
“Powerful basic computing, video streaming, photo and video editing - the 9th 
generation … processor does it all” – and that there was no reference to gaming in 
that description;

Mr A says that the computer isn’t suitable for his daughter’s gaming needs and that 
he’s made lots of other purchases from the retailer using his credit account and not 
complained about any of them - but I’m not persuaded that there’s enough evidence 
to show that the retailer represented to him that the computer would be a good 
computer for playing the games that his daughter plays;

I sympathise with Mr A that he’s bought a computer that isn’t suitable for his 
daughter’s gaming needs but I’m not persuaded that there’s enough evidence to 
show that the retailer misrepresented the computer to him in these circumstances;

Mr A has complained about the customer service that he’s received from the retailer 
and from Creation Consumer Finance – although Mr A is clearly frustrated by the 
retailer’s customer service, that isn’t something for which Creation Consumer 
Finance would be liable under section 75;

Mr A complained to Creation Consumer Finance in May 2021 but it didn’t issue its 
final response to him until September 2021 – that was longer than it should have 
taken which is likely to have caused further frustration to Mr A – but I consider that 
the response that it sent to him was fair and reasonable and I’m not persuaded that 
an award of compensation for that delay is justified in these circumstances; and 

I find that it wouldn’t be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer 
Finance to allow Mr A to reject the computer, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I don’t uphold Mr A’s complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2022.
