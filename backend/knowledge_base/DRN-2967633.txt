The complaint
Mrs G has complained that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd rejected her claim against it 
under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
What happened
Mrs G bought solar panels for her home in January 2016. The purchase was funded by a 
loan from Creation, and that business is therefore liable for the acts and omissions of the 
installer under the relevant legislation. In this case, that relates to the installer misleading 
Mrs G into believing that the panels would be self-funding, which they weren’t.
Mrs G’s complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. She thought that the benefits 
of the panels were mis-represented to the consumer, and that fair redress would be for the 
loan to be restructured to effectively make the panels self-funding. This restructure should be 
based on evidence of the actual performance of the panels, and a number of assumptions 
on future performance. Creation didn’t respond so the case was passed to an ombudsman. 
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Creation is familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at complaints of this type, and indeed our well-established approach. So I don’t 
consider it necessary to set all of that out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, for the same reasons as those explained 
by the adjudicator, I uphold this case. In brief, that is because the evidence supports the 
conclusion that a misrepresentation took place and Mrs G was not given clear information to 
demonstrate that the solar panels would not be self-funding and would equate to an 
additional cost for her.
So I think that Creation didn’t treat Mrs G fairly and she lost out because of what Creation 
did wrong. And this means that it should put things right.
Putting things right
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mrs G’s complaint for Creation to put things right by recalculating the 
original loan based on the known and assumed savings and income to Mrs G from the solar 
panels over the term of the loan so she pays no more than that, and she keeps the solar 
panel system, and any future benefits once the loan has ended. 
If the event the calculation shows that Mrs G is paying (or has paid) more than she should 
have Creation need to reimburse Mrs G accordingly.  Should the calculation show that the 
mis-presentation has not caused a financial loss, then the calculation should be shared with 
Mrs G by way of explanation.  
If the calculation shows there is a loss, then where the loan is ongoing, I require Creation to 
restructure Mrs G’s loan. They should recalculate the loan to put Mrs G in a position where 
the solar panel system is cost neutral over the term of the loan.
Normally, by recalculating the loan this way, Mrs G’s monthly repayments would reduce, 
meaning that she would’ve paid more each month than she should’ve done resulting in an 
overpayment balance. And as a consumer would have been deprived of the monthly 
overpayment, I would expect a business to add 8% simple interest from the date of the 
overpayment to the date of settlement. So I think the fairest resolution would be to let Mrs G 
have the following options as to how she would like her overpayments to be used:
a) the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and Mrs G 
continues to make her current monthly payment resulting in the loan finishing early,
b) the overpayments are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan and Mrs G 
pays a new monthly payment until the end of the loan term,
c)
the overpayments are returned to Mrs G and she continues to make her current 
monthly payment resulting in her loan finishing early, or
d) the overpayments are returned to Mrs G and she pays a new monthly payment until 
the end of the loan term.
If Mrs G accepts my decision, she should indicate on the acceptance form which option she 
wishes to accept.
If the Mrs G has settled the loan, Creation should pay Mrs G the difference between what 
she paid in total and what the loan should have been under the restructure above, with 8% 
interest.
If Mrs G has settled the loan by refinancing, she should supply evidence of the refinance, to 
Creation and Creation should: 
1.
Refund the extra Mrs G paid each month with the Creation loan.
2.
Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mrs G receives her refund.
3.
Refund the extra Mrs G paid with the refinanced loan.
4.
Add simple interest from the date of each payment until Mrs G receives her refund.
5.
Pay Mrs G the difference between the amount now owed and the amount she 
would’ve owed if the system had been self-funding
I’m satisfied that there was sufficient information available at the time that Mrs G first 
contacted Creation that means the claim should have been upheld. I direct that Creation 
should pay £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused. 
My final decision
For the reasons I’ve explained, I’m upholding Mrs G’s complaint. Creation Consumer 
Finance Ltd should put things right in the way I’ve set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2022.
