The complaint
Mr O complains that Creation Consumer Finance Limited (CCF) is charging him for an TV he 
says is not fit for purpose. He would be happy with a replacement 
. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I won’t repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons: -

Mr O has evidenced a crack on the TV screen, but I must decide if this is something 
that CCF is liable for or not.

Mr O took out a buy now pay later plan (BNPL) for his TV on 18 April 2020.  He had a 
thirty day right to reject the item if it was damaged or unsuitable.  Unfortunately, Mr O 
didn’t complain about the TV until 20 July 2020 some three months after he took his 
agreement. So, he missed his thirty day right to reject.

I have considered if there are any exceptional reasons as to why Mr O didn’t 
complain for three months but I don’t think there are. I appreciate Mr O says he left 
the TV, when delivered, unopened for some time in a property that he had limited 
access to due to the pandemic.  I appreciate the difficulties caused by the pandemic, 
but I am not sure why Mr O didn’t check the item when it first arrived and then re box 
it to leave it until he needed  it.

Finally, Mr O hasn’t been able to evidence that the item was damaged when he got it. 
Without any such evidence I can’t reasonably conclude that CCF should replace the 
item as Mr O would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don’t uphold this complaint 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 December 2021.
