The complaint
Mr N has complained about the way Creation Consumer Finance Ltd (“Creation”) responded 
to claims he’d made in relation to misrepresentation, breach of contract, and an alleged 
unfair relationship taking into account section 140A (“s140A”) of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 (the “CCA”).
Mr N has been represented in bringing his complaint but, to keep things simple, I’ll refer to 
Mr N throughout. 
What happened
In June 2015 Mr N entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation to pay for a 
£10,999 solar panel system (“the system”) from a supplier I’ll call “E”. The total amount 
payable under the agreement was £17,061.60 and it was due to be paid back with 120 
monthly repayments of £142.18. E installed the system in July 2015.
In October 2021 Mr N sent a letter of claim to Creation explaining he thought the system was 
mis-sold. He said E told him he’d be paid for the electricity the system generated through the 
government’s Feed in Tariff (FIT) payments and that the system would be self-funding. He 
said E told him the system would be maintenance free with a 40-year life expectancy and his 
energy bills would go down. 
Mr N said the system was misrepresented and believed the statements and several other 
actions at the time of the sale created an unfair relationship between himself and Creation. 
Creation sent a final response letter in December 2021 to say it was dismissing the 
complaint without consideration because it had been brought out of time. 
Unhappy with Creation’s response, Mr N decided to refer his complaint to the Financial 
Ombudsman in January 2022. 
One of our investigators looked into things and thought E had likely told Mr N the system 
would be self-funding and that the documentation didn’t clearly set out it wasn’t. He didn’t 
think the system was self-funding over the course of the loan term, and so he thought E had 
misrepresented it. He thought a court would likely find the relationship between Mr N and 
Creation was unfair and that he’d suffered a loss through entering into the agreement. He 
thought Creation should recalculate the loan based on known and assumed savings and 
income over the course of the loan so that he pays no more than that, and he keeps the 
system. He also recommended £100 compensation for the impact of Creation not 
investigating the s.140A claim. 
Mr N agreed, but I can’t see we received a response from Creation. As things weren’t 
resolved, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.  
What I’ve decided – and why
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My findings on jurisdiction 
The Unfair relationship under s.140A complaint 
The event complained of here is Creation’s participation, for so long as the credit relationship 
continues, in an alleged unfair relationship with Mr N. Here the relationship was ongoing at 
the time it was referred to the ombudsman service in January 2022, so the complaint has 
been brought in time for the purposes of our jurisdiction.
Merits
The unfair relationship under s.140A complaint
When considering whether representations and contractual promises by E can be 
considered under s.140A I’ve looked at the court’s approach to s.140A. 
In Scotland & Reast v British Credit Trust [2014] EWCA Civ 790 the Court of Appeal said a 
court must consider the whole relationship between the creditor and the debtor arising out of 
the credit agreement and whether it is unfair, including having regard to anything done (or 
not done) by or on behalf of the creditor before the making of the agreement. A 
misrepresentation by the creditor or a false or misleading presentation are relevant and 
important aspects of a transaction. 
Section 56 (“s.56”) of the CCA has the effect of deeming E to be the agent of Creation in any 
antecedent negotiations. 
Taking this into account, I consider it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances 
for me to consider as part of the complaint about an alleged unfair relationship those 
negotiations and arrangements by E for which Creation were responsible under s.56 when 
considering whether it is likely Creation had acted fairly and reasonably towards Mr N. 
But in doing so, I should take into account all the circumstances and consider whether a 
court would likely find the relationship with Creation was unfair under s.140A.
What happened?
Mr N says he was verbally misled that the system would effectively pay for itself. I’ve taken 
account of what Mr N says he was told, and I’ve reviewed the documentation that I’ve been 
supplied.  
The fixed sum loan agreement sets out the amount being borrowed; the interest charged; 
the total amount payable; the term; and the contractual monthly loan repayments. I think this 
was set out clearly enough for Mr N to be able to understand what was required to be repaid 
towards the agreement.
Mr N has also supplied some further information from around the point of sale. We’ve been 
supplied an MCS certificate setting out the estimated annual generation in kWh. He’s 
supplied us a registration certificate. He’s supplied a performance estimate document that 
was signed two weeks after the fixed sum loan. This set out the estimated kWh yield and 
also set out that there was an estimated year one benefit of £643.30 and an estimated 20-
year benefit of £12,866. The form also had a section for space heating and said the total 
estimated year one benefit was £240 and the potential 20-year benefit was £4,800. He’s 
supplied SEM calculations. He’s also given us two tables showing estimates of savings, one 
of which was for a £10,999 system. This table indicates the total income and savings would 
grow from around £1,350 in the first year to around £1,770 by the 10th year. It also indicates 
that by the 11th year there’d be profit being made.  
I’m conscious it seems Mr N signed the documents including estimates two weeks after he 
signed the fixed sum loan agreement. The fixed sum loan didn’t set out any of the potential 
savings he’d make from having the system installed. Some of the estimated savings figures 
seem to be conflicting. I don’t think there was an easy way for Mr N to have been able to 
compare the total costs against the benefits he was allegedly being promised when he 
signed the fixed sum loan agreement. Mr N has indicated he signed the fixed sum loan 
agreement based on what he was told by E – i.e., that the system would be self-funding. 
While the estimated savings document he signed two weeks later doesn’t show the system 
would pay for itself, I can understand why Mr N would have thought the system would be 
self-funding based on looking at the table. It looks like E may have overestimated the 
electricity savings Mr N was likely to make. The form also shows profits are being made from 
the 11th year whereas this doesn’t take into account the accumulated losses made during the 
loan term. I think Mr N’s allegations E told him it would be self-funding seem plausible. 
For the solar panels to be self-funding, they’d need to produce a combined savings and FIT 
income of around £1,700 per year. But I’ve not seen anything to suggest Mr N’s system 
achieved anywhere near the benefits required to make the system self-funding within the 
term of the agreement, even though I think it’s slightly overperformed compared to the 
estimate on the MCS certificate. I therefore find the representations that were likely made 
weren’t true. I think the salesperson ought to have known this and made it clear the system 
wouldn’t have produced enough benefits to cover the overall cost of the fixed sum loan 
agreement during its term.
I think E’s representative must reasonably have been aware that Mr N’s system would not 
have produced benefits at the level required to be self-funding. Whilst there are elements of 
the calculations that had to be estimated, the amount of sunlight as an example, I think E’s 
representative would have known that Mr N’s system would not produce enough benefits to 
cover the overall cost of the system in the timescales stated verbally to him.
Considering Mr N’s account about what he was told, the time between signing documents; 
the documentation; and that Creation hasn’t disputed what’s been said, I think it likely E 
gave Mr N a false and misleading impression of the self-funding nature of the system. Given 
his lack of prior interest and the financial burden he took on I find Mr N’s account of what he 
was told by E credible and persuasive. The loan is a costly long-term commitment, and I 
can’t see why he would have seen this purchase appealing had E not given the 
reassurances he said he received. 
I consider E’s misleading presentation went to an important aspect of the transaction for the 
system, namely the benefits and savings which Mr N expected to receive by agreeing to the 
installation of the system. I consider that E’s assurances in this regard likely amounted to a 
contractual promise that the system would have the capacity to fund the loan repayments. 
But, even if they did not have that effect, they nonetheless represented the basis upon which 
Mr N went into the transaction. Either way, I think E’s assurances were seriously misleading 
and false, undermining the purpose of the transaction from Mr N’s point of view.
Would the court be likely to make a finding of unfairness under s.140A?
Where Creation is to be treated as responsible for E’s negotiations with Mr N in respect of its 
misleading and false assurances as to the self-funding nature of the solar panel system, I’m 
persuaded a court would likely conclude that because of this the relationship between Mr N 
and Creation was unfair.
Because of this shortfall between his costs and the actual benefits, each month he has had 
to pay more than he expected to cover the difference between his solar benefits and the cost 
of the loan. So, clearly Creation has benefitted from the interest paid on a loan he would 
otherwise have not taken out.
Fair compensation 
In all the circumstances I consider that fair compensation should aim to remedy the 
unfairness of Mr N and Creation’s relationship arising out of E’s misleading and false 
assurances as to the self-funding nature of the solar panel system. Creation should repay 
Mr N a sum that corresponds to the outcome he could reasonably have expected as a result 
of E’s assurances. That is, that Mr N’s loan repayments should amount to no more than the 
financial benefits he receives for the duration of the loan agreement. 
Therefore, to resolve the complaint, Creation should recalculate the agreement based on the 
known and assumed savings and income Mr N received (or will receive) from the system 
over the 10-year term of the loan, so he pays no more than that. To do that, I think it’s 
important to consider the benefit Mr N received by way of FIT payments as well as through 
energy savings. Mr N will need to supply up to date details of all FIT benefits received, 
electricity bills and current meter readings to Creation. 
Creation should also be aware that whether my determination constitutes a money award or 
direction (or a combination), what I decide is fair compensation need not be what a court 
would award or order. This reflects the nature of the ombudsman service’s scheme as one 
which is intended to be fair, quick, and informal.
I also find Creation’s refusal to consider the claim has also caused Mr N some further 
inconvenience. And I think the £100 compensation recommended by our investigator is 
broadly a fair way to recognise that.
Finally, I note Mr N also mentioned claiming damages through section 75 (“s.75”). Given my 
above conclusions and bearing in mind the purpose of my decision is to provide a fair 
outcome quickly with minimal formality, I don’t think I need to provide a detailed analysis of 
Mr N’s s.75 complaint. Furthermore, this doesn’t stop me from reaching a fair outcome in the 
circumstances.  
My final decision
For the reasons I have explained I uphold Mr N’s complaint. To put things right Creation 
Consumer Finance Ltd must:

Calculate the total payments (the deposit and monthly repayments) Mr N has made 
towards the solar panel system up until the date of settlement of his complaint – A

Use Mr N’s bills and FIT statements to work out the benefits he received up until the 
date of settlement of his complaint* – B

Use B to recalculate what Mr N should have paid each month towards the loan over 
that period and calculate the difference, between what he actually paid (A), and what 
he should have paid, applying 8% simple annual interest to any overpayment from 
the date of each payment until the date of settlement** – C

Reimburse C to Mr N

Use Mr N’s bills and FIT statements to work out the benefits he will receive for the 
period between the settlement of his complaint and the end of the original loan term* 
– D

Rework the loan so that the remaining balance is D and recalculate the remaining 
monthly payments equally over the remaining term of the loan.

Pay Mr N an additional £100 compensation
*Where Mr N has not been able to provide all the details of his meter readings, electricity 
bills and/or FIT benefits, I am satisfied he has provided sufficient information in order for 
Creation to complete the calculation I have directed it follow in the circumstances using 
known and reasonably assumed benefits. 
**If Creation Consumer Finance Ltd considers that it’s required by HM Revenue & Customs 
to deduct income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr N how much it’s taken off. It should 
also give Mr N a tax deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from 
HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 July 2024.
