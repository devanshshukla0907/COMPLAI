complaint
Mr Z complains that Creation Consumer Finance Ltd mis-sold a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy to him. 
background
In 2006 Mr Z bought furniture in a shop. He took out a £1,999 loan to pay for it. At the same 
time Creation sold him a PPI policy. The policy cost £652.02, which was added to the loan. 
The loan had a 12-month ‘buy now pay later’ feature. Mr Z wouldn’t pay interest if he paid off 
the credit before that date. Otherwise he’d pay interest (including £581.55 of interest on the 
policy) over the remaining 36 months of the loan. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Z’s complaint. He thought Creation had advised Mr Z to buy the 
policy. But he didn’t think it had properly told Mr Z how much it would cost. 
Creation disagreed. It said the cost was set out in the loan agreement and other paperwork it 
gave to Mr Z.  
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think the relevant issues to take into account are the same as those set out in the 
information on our website about our approach to PPI complaints.
I’ve decided to uphold Mr Z’s complaint. I don’t agree with the adjudicator that this was an 
advised sale. But I do agree that Creation didn’t properly tell Mr Z how much the policy cost. 
I say this because:

The credit agreement set out the PPI premium and the total cost. But it didn’t show the 
PPI interest as a separate figure. It wasn’t reasonable to expect Mr Z to work it out for 
himself. He was entitled to expect all the important information about the cost of the 
policy to be in the loan agreement.

The statement of price did set out the interest. But it was on page two of the policy 
summary. It wasn’t easy to find, or where Mr Z would expect it to be. And I can’t be sure 
it was drawn to his attention; particularly when he was in a shop and his attention was on 
buying furniture, not on buying insurance. 

None of the paperwork set out the monthly cost of the policy. This would have been good 
practice and might have helped Mr Z better understand what the policy was costing him.  

The information in the credit agreement also wasn’t enough to make Mr Z aware of the 
effect the ‘buy now pay later’ period would have on the interest charged. If he didn’t pay 
the loan off during the first 12 months the whole loan, including the PPI cost, attracted 
interest at 29.8%. This meant Mr Z would pay a substantial extra amount of interest on 
the PPI cost in the first year; when the only benefit he gained was ‘free’ life cover.


The PPI interest was high compared to the cost of the policy. And the total policy cost 
was high compared to the amount Mr Z was borrowing. This was unusual. I think Mr Z 
would have seen this as important information when deciding whether to buy the policy. 
Especially as he was borrowing a fairly modest amount for non-essential items. 

I don’t think Mr Z would have bought the policy if he‘d been made properly aware of how 
much it was going to cost him.
For these reasons, I uphold Mr Z’s complaint. 
fair compensation
Mr Z should be put back in the position he would now be in if he’d taken out the loan without 
the PPI policy. I understand the loan and the policy ran for their full term.
Creation should now therefore:
A. Work out and repay the extra monthly payments paid by Mr Z because PPI was added to 
the loan by:

calculating how much the loan payments would have been if Mr Z had taken out the loan 
without PPI;

subtracting those amounts from what Mr Z actually paid, and paying him the difference; 
and

paying Mr Z simple interest on each of these amounts at 8% a year from the date each 
payment was made to the date the compensation is paid†.
B. Write to Mr Z setting out the details of the calculations and amounts under (A).
† I understand Creation is required to deduct basic rate tax from this part of the 
compensation. Whether Mr Z needs to take any further action will depend on his financial 
circumstances. More information about the tax position can be found on our website.
Mr Z should refer back to Creation if he’s unsure of the approach it has taken. And Mr Z and 
Creation should contact HM Revenue & Customs if they want to know more about the tax 
treatment of this part of the compensation.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Z’s complaint. Creation Consumer Finance Ltd must pay him the compensation 
I’ve described.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2014.
