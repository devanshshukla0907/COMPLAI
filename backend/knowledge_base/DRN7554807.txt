complaint
Mrs M complains that some replacement windows and doors that she paid for using a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance Limited weren’t of satisfactory quality.
background
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I won’t repeat them again here. Instead I’ll focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
I’ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what’s fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:

Mrs M entered in to a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance, 
that she electronically signed in October 2017, to pay for some replacement windows 
and doors – the cost of the work was £22,350 and she paid a deposit of £11,153 so 
the loan was for £11,197 which she agreed to repay by 60 monthly repayments of 
£286.07;

Mrs M complained to the supplier about some issues with the work so it inspected 
them and identified that some rectification work was required – but before the 
rectification work could be completed the supplier stopped trading;

Mrs M complained to Creation Consumer Finance and then to this service – and she 
stopped making payments to Creation Consumer Finance so her account went into 
arrears – she also paid £950 for the works to be inspected by an independent expert 
in March 2020;

the expert’s report concluded that the windows weren’t fit for purpose and that 
remedial work was required as described in his report;

our investigator recommended that Creation Consumer Finance should: make good 
the internal window boards and reveals due to the staining caused by rainwater; 
complete the rectification work based on three quotes that she should obtain; pay her 
£750 for the trouble and upset caused; reimburse her for the cost of the inspection 
report; and amend any adverse information recorded on her credit file;

Creation Consumer Finance has accepted the investigator’s recommendations but it 
says that it can’t remove the adverse information on her credit file until the arrears on 
her account are cleared – and it suggests that the compensation payable to Mrs M 
should be credited to her account to reduce her arrears;

Mrs M hasn’t accepted those recommendations and says that: she should receive 
more compensation; she should be reimbursed for the cost of decorating that she’s 
already paid for; she’s getting more leaks from the windows and more damage is 
being caused; it will take her a lot of time and effort to get three quotes for the 
remedial work; and the supplier guaranteed the windows for 25 years but she’s only 
being offered a ten year guarantee on the quote that she obtained for replacing the 
windows;


our investigator agreed that Creation Consumer Finance shouldn’t be required to 
rectify the ongoing effect on Mrs M’s credit file until the arrears are cleared – and she 
says that she’s going to be making a claim for damages against Creation Consumer 
Finance and won’t be settling any outstanding amount until it removes all of the 
interest from her account;

in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;

to be able to uphold Mrs M’s complaint about Creation Consumer Finance, I must be 
satisfied that there’s been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
of the windows and that Creation Consumer Finance‘s response to her claim under 
section 75 wasn’t fair or reasonable – but I’m not determining the outcome of Mrs M’s 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;

there doesn’t seem to be any dispute that there’s been a breach of contract – the 
supplier identified that some rectification work was required but has stopped trading 
and the windows were inspected by an independent expert who said that they 
weren’t fit for purpose – but Creation Consumer Finance has accepted our 
investigator’s recommendations and has agreed to pay for the remedial works and 
some making good, to pay her £750 compensation, and to reimburse her for the cost 
of the report; 

I sympathise with Mrs M for the issues that she’s been caused and for the continuing 
time and effort required to obtain three quotes for the remedial work and the distress 
and inconvenience that she’ll be caused by those works – but I consider that the 
outcome recommended by our investigator is fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances;

I don’t consider that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Creation 
Consumer Finance to reimburse Mrs M for the cost of the decorating that she’s 
already had done, to pay her more than £750 to compensate her for the distress and 
inconvenience that she’s been caused or to remove the interest from her account;

the expert’s report estimates that the cost of the remedial woks is likely to be 
between £10,000 and £12,000 (excluding VAT) so I don’t consider that it’s unfair or 
unreasonable for Mrs M to provide it with three quotes for the remedial works and to 
agree with Creation Consumer Finance which quote to accept;

Mrs M says that the windows came with a 25 year guarantee but a quote that she 
obtained for replacing the windows only came with a ten year guarantee – that isn’t 
something for which Creation Consumer Finance is responsible; 

Mrs M has stopped making payments to Creation Consumer Finance so her account 
is in arrears – if she clears those arrears I consider that it would be fair and 
reasonable for Creation Consumer Finance to remove any adverse information about 
her missed payments from her credit file – but I’m not persuaded that it would be fair 
or reasonable for me to require that the compensation payable to Mrs M should be 
credited to her account to reduce her arrears (but she can use it for that purpose if 
she chooses to do so); and

I find that Mrs M’s complaint should be upheld on the basis set out below.

my final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs M’s complaint in part and I order Creation Consumer 
Finance Limited to:
1.
Make good the internal window boards and reveals that have been stained by 
rainwater.
2.
Pay for the remedial works identified in the independent expert’s report – Mrs M 
should obtain three quotes for those works and agree with Creation Consumer 
Finance which quote to accept.
3.
Reimburse Mrs M for the cost of the independent report – but she must provide it 
with evidence to show the amount that she paid for the report.
4.
Pay £750 to Mrs M to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that she’s 
been caused.
5.
Remove any adverse information about Miss M’s missed payments from her credit 
file if she clears the arrears on her account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I’m required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 April 2021.
